Scene 1: Opening

[The DreamWorks Animation SKG logo begins as the Penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private attack the boy on the moon and they use a fishing pole to catch some fish.]

Skipper: Well done, boys. Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast. (All give a high-5!)

[A long time ago in Africa during the 80's or 90's, a male adult lion king named Zuba was playing with his infant son Alakay (known as Alex), who is going to dance as Zuba tries to teach Alakay how to fight with a maraca that looks like a lion as a dummy.]

Zuba: No, no, son. Over here. See the lion? Look at the lion and get the lion! (Sighs and grunts) Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.

Baby Alex: Da-da.

Zuba: [chuckles] Now, Alakay, let me show you something. OK? You see this mark? You and me are the same. When you're bigger, you'll wanna be an Alpha Lion, just like your daddy. Now let me see you fight. (Baby Alex growls) Ready? (But Baby Alex dances again) No, Alakay. No dancing! You just amuse yourself, don't you? You're a strange kid. You're a strange one. I'm... [Laughing as Baby Alex uses his hand move up and down of his faces] Now, come on, let's try it again. No, Alakay. Stop that-- Stop that right now. Doggone it!

[From the bushes, a male lion with a stylish mane comes up. His name is Makunga, who is Zuba's brother.]

Makunga: It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want to.

Zuba: Makunga. You're not challenging me again, are you?

Makunga: Look on the bright side, Zuba. After I defeat you and take over as the alpha lion, you'll have so much more time to spend with your pathetic excuse of a son.

Zuba: Before I kick your butt, let me ask you: Why do you even want to become the alpha lion?

Makunga: I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart... and I want everyone else to do what I say.

Zuba: (Groans)

Makunga: We'll fight on three. One...

Zuba: Pay attention, Alakay. Daddy gonna show you how it's done.

Makunga: [quickly] Two, three!

[Zuba starts fighting Makunga while Baby Alex continued playing with the butterfly. He saw a small, long rope and Alakay followed it.]

Zuba: Who's the alpha lion?

Makunga: You are.

Zuba: Don't you forget it. And that, Alakay, is how you attack... (He sees that Baby Alex is gone) Alakay?

[On the signs of "No Hunting", Baby Alex finally gets the rope as he sees some hunters]

Hunter #1: That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

Hunter #2: (Using his gun cock, but decides to cease fire) Ah! This one's a beauty. He'll be worth a few bucks.

Hunter #1: It just gets easier and easier. [Chuckles evilly]

[The hunters put Baby Alex into a crate]

Baby Alex: (Whimpering) Daddy!!

Zuba: Alakay! Alakay!! ALAKAY!!!!!!

[Zuba sees a crate and notices that Baby Alex is inside it]

Baby Alex: Da-da!

Zuba: No! No! No! Alakay!

[Zuba ran on all fours chasing after the truck. He leaped on and tried to free his son.]

Baby Alex: Daddy!

Zuba: Alakay! Daddy's got you! Hold on!

[When Zuba unleashes the ropes to free his son, the hunter shoots him by his ear, bleeding]

Baby Alex: Da-da! (Whimpers) Ow! Ow!

[And when the truck turns around the corner, the crate fell off the truck, and Baby Alex inside the crate fell for the first time. The crate fell into the river. Zuba gets up as he clutches his ear and then he continues chasing after the truck, thinking that Alakay is still on there.]

Zuba: ALAKAY!!!!!!

Baby Alex: Daddy!

Baby Marty: (jealous) I don't like the looks of this guy.

Baby Gloria: Well, I think he's kind of cute.

Baby Marty: I think he's kind of a showoff.

Baby Melman: Y-You think he's cute? (Coughs)

(Baby Alex keeps dancing on the rock to the people and leaps!)

All: Whoa!

[And when Baby Alex prepares a land, many years later, he became all grown up and becomes a super big star!]

Adult Alex: ROAR!!!!

(Crowd cheers wildly as they hold up )

Announcer: The King of New York City... Alex the Lion!

Marty: Woo-hoo! I still think he's kind of a showoff.

Melman: You gotta give it to him. The guy's an animal.

Marty: Maybe he should take a break. You know, we could all use a vacation.

Gloria: Come on, where on Earth would we go on vacation?

Marty: I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!

[The scene changes to the news events of the incident in grand central station from first film]

News Anchor Woman #1: On the loose, several animals including the world famous Alex the Lion the king of New York, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight. The escapees were finally cornered in Grand Central Station.

[Nana was being interviewed by the public.]

Nana: He was a very bad kitty.

[The scene shows of taking the escaped animals from the crates on the freighter of going to Kenya before the Penguins infiltrate it of going to Antarctica, with it being a deleted scene of where the they put the escaped animals on the boat being seen.]

News Anchor Woman #2: Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the escaped animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the shipping freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.

[The scene shows some New Yorkers mourning the loss of Alex at nightfall.]

News Anchor Man: Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the Central Park Zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals. The question on everyone's mind-- where are they now?
Scene 3: Leaving the Island/Going to New York

[And in the meantime back at the present day in Madagascar, Alex and his gang are dancing to the beat from the elevator of preparing a blast off to their home of New York by an Airplane of Air Penguin]

Alex: I like to move it, move it

Gloria: He likes to move it, move it

Marty: She likes to move it, move it

Melman: We like to

Lemur Crowd: Move it!

Marty: Come on! Y'all know this one! It never gets stale!

We like to

Move it!

Alex: We'll miss you little fuzz buckets! You've been a great crowd!

Melman: Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.

Alex: If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first. (watches as what two lemurs are doing) Seriously though, call. OK?

Maurice: Settle down, everybody. Shh! Be quiet! (as everyone quiets down, Maurice comes with a cake) You can't leave without this!

[King Julien pops out of the cake, King Julien Moves It is being played in the background]

King Julien: Hey! Surprise, freaks! Shake it! Shake it. (Laughing) Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone! I'm a lady! Not really! It's me, King Julien! Which of you is attracted to me? Hands up! (Laughing) Yes! Hey, freaks! You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.

Alex: (Chuckles) Oh, no, thank you.

King Julien: Yes, thank you. It's my plane! Until I return with the spoils from the new country... (holds Stevie the Gecko in his hand) Stevie will be in charge!

[The crowd didn't say anything]

Maurice: I don't think they like that idea so much, Julien.

King Julien: What is that you saying, Stevie? No. (Gasps) Could we? No, you didn't say that! How is that even possible? Naughty little thing! Stevie says... [gibberish language of what is Stevie saying] Let them eat cake!

Mort: King Julien, wait for me! I'm all packed! I have a whole itinerary planned!

[King Julien sees Mort coming]

King Julien: Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying! Don't let him on. Stop that thing! He's uh... carrying scissors and hand cream! [Four lemurs try to stop Mort] Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in! Get in quick! Get in quick!!

Skipper: Struts.

Kowalski: Check.

Skipper: Flaps.

Kowalski: Check.

Skipper: Engine.

Kowalski: Check.

Skipper: Coffee maker.

Kowalski: Check.

Mort: Have fun, you guys! (Laughing while holding scissors in his hand)

Julien: Oopsie-daisy!

Skipper: That's got to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen. But it's gonna have to do. Attention. This is your captain speaking.

Private: In the event of an water emergency, place the vest over your head, then kiss your... (inflates a lifejacket, but explodes) good-bye.

Gloria: New York City, here we come!

Skipper: We'd like you to sit back, relax and pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies.

Alex: Personal God, hunk? What?

Kowalski: We are go, sir.

Mort: Open the door! I'm outside! (Screams)

Private: If case of loss in cabin pressure, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression from the other passengers.

Marty: Excuse me miss, [holds a seatbelt] but aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?

Private: No, sir.

Skipper: OK, boys, launch!

Rico: Hai.

Lemur #1: Launch!

Lemur #2: Launch!

Lemur #3: Launch!

(All lemurs release the guillotine while the gang is screaming and the plane begins to fly to New York as the lemurs celebrate. And when the scene now goes to thunder, Alex sees a scary animal that is messing with the wires on the plane)

Alex: AAHH!! Gremlin!

(After the plane was out of the cloudy skies, it turns out that Alex had a dream, and it turned out that it was just Mort)

Alex: (Sighs) Hey, Mort.

Mort: Hi! (Screams)

(Alex looks to see where Mort went)

Alex: (Whispering) That was weird.

Marty: Hey, somebody's dreaming, huh.

Alex: I think I just saw Mort on the wing of the plane.

Melman: You got Madagascar on the brain.

[Alex, Marty, and Gloria all talk at once]

Gloria: I know I'm gonna miss it.

Alex: It was incredible. Yeah, I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.

Marty: Like when you bit me on the butt?

(Gloria laughs)

Alex: I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage. It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.

Marty: Are the butts next to the croutons at the salad bar?

(All laughing)

Alex: You don't need to be sarcastic, Marty.

Gloria: Hey guys, you know. I was thinking. When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.

Melman: Breeding program?

Gloria: I think we rack each a point in our lives when we want to meet somebody. You know? Settle down, have a relationship.

Marty: I can see that.

Melman: What? (clears throat) Like dating?

Gloria: Yeah, dating.

Melman: Oth-Other... oth-other guys?

Gloria: What do you mean, other guys?

Melman: Darn it! I'm gonna...What is holding up that beverage service?! I'm gonna go check.

Gloria: (yawns as she is going to sleep) You all keep talking. I'm gonna catch a few winks.

Julien: You see that? It's so funny! Oh, I like laughing! It's such a nice experience! To laugh!

Melman: Wow!

Julien: Whoa! Sorry. Do you mind going back? This is first class. It's nothing personal. We're just better than you. Hey Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

Maurice: He shoots, he scores!

Melman: Is that Vivaldi?

Julien: Hey, in-flight slave.

Private: Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

Julien: Bring me my nuts on a silver platter.

Melman: We just wanted to check in on the drinks we ordered.

Private: Oh, sorry. Been a little backed up.

Melman: I guess I'll go back..

Julien: Hey, what happened to your body? You're freaking me out! Can you please go over there, please? Thank you very much. What ever happened to the separation of the classes?

Maurice: Ah, I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.

[In the meantime at the cockpit, a red light flashes as a buzz of warning for something wrong on the plane.]

Skipper: We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

Kowalski: Skipper, look!

Skipper: Analysis.

Kowalski: It looks like a small incandescent bulb; designed to indicate something out of the ordinary, like a malfunction.

Skipper: I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

Kowalski: That too, sir.

Skipper: Right! Rico? Manual! Mmm-hmm. [Uses the manual to break the red light] Problemo solved.

Kowalski: Sir, we may be out of fuel.

Skipper: What makes you think that?

Kowalski: We've lost engine one... [Looks at Wing #1 and sees that it stopped moving, Wing #2 has fire] and engine two is no longer on fire.

Skipper: Buckle up, boys.

[Kowalski and Rico buckled their seatbelts]

Skipper: Don't look, doll. This might get hairy. Attention! This is your captain speaking. I've got good and bad news. The good news is, we'll be landing immediately. The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

[And everyone, except Gloria, Mason and Phil, starts to scream for their death of an airplane falling!]

Skipper: When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice whatsoever. But thanks again for choosing Air Penguin.

(The boys are bumping as Alex, Marty, and Melman are still screaming! And Melman crashes with luggages)

Julien: [Laughing as Maurice frightenedly buckles his seatbelt] Raise your arms, Maurice! It's more fun when you raise your arms like this! [Laughing as he and Maurice come out of the plane and they have a parachute] I can fly!

Alex: This could be it, Marty! I just want you to know that you're truly a one in a million-friend!

Marty: Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

Alex: I know you won't mind when I tell you!

Marty: Come on! Tell me anything! Tell me what?!

Alex: I broke your iPod!

Marty: What?!

Alex: The buttons were so small, it made me mad!

Marty: Oh, no! The horror!

Alex: I'm sorry!

Marty: I'm gonna kill you, butt-biter!

Alex: It was an accident! An accident!

Marty: Butt-biter!

Melman: I love you, Gloria! I always have! [Gloria snores as everything is going to calm down, Melman looks at Alex, Marty, Mason, and Phil, who just watch and don't say any word] Like... (sighs) Like you love the beach. [stammering] Or a good book. Or the beach.

[The plane is still falling as Alex, Marty, and Melman continue screaming while they have beverages for Private]

Skipper: My goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf. Rico! You've had your fun, pull up.

[And the plane still flies as it enters Africa]

Skipper: Gear down. Gently now. You just want to kiss the ground. Just a little peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.

[But the plane hits the ground harder and begins to crash!]

Skipper: I said, kiss it!!!

[And the plane begin break in many pieces, as the front still stands]

Skipper: Now just a little brake. Just a touch. A little whisper.

[Mason and Phil are playing Chess on the plane]

Mason: I believe that's checkmate.

[Alex, Marty, and Melman continue screaming, while the plane is falling]

Skipper: Commence emergency landing procedure. Flaps up! Deploy!

[The plane lands slowly and touches the ground softly as the parachutes come down]

Gloria: Oh, we're here. [confused] What in the world? What happened to the plane? What did y'all do to the plane?

Melman: [muffled] Is this thing ever working?

Marty: I'm OK. I'm alive.

Melman: [muffled] Hey guys?

Gloria: I can't even sleep for a minute. You know what? This is not JFK. I don't think.

Alex: Wow.

Skipper: [as Alex watches] Kowalski, casualty report.

Kowalski: Two passengers unaccounted for Skipper.

Skipper: That's a number I can live with. Good landing, boys! Who says a penguin can't fly? (All give a High-5!)

[Alex watches Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private giving High 5's]

Alex: [as he walks up close] Hey, happy slappers! Is there some reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

Skipper: We'll fix it.

Alex: Fix it? How are you gonna fix this?

Skipper: Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape. We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.

Alex: Sixty-nine months?!

Skipper: No, six TO nine months. Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.

Alex: Where'd you get that number?

Skipper: I want you to reconfigure the design.

Alex: How do you estimate that?

Skipper: Pretty boy! Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine? Maybe find water.

Alex: Hold on a second. Who made you king of the plane wreck?

Skipper: Excuse me? (Rico pulls out a pocket knife) Fine. You can be in charge. You fix the plane.

Alex: Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?

Skipper: OK, then I'll remain in charge.

(Rico puts away the pocket knife)

Alex: Yeah. That's right. You will remain in charge.

Skipper: You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.

Alex: Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

Skipper: Good for you.

Alex: Well, guess what? This discussion isn't over. (He leaves)

Skipper: Higher mammals! (Mason and Phil are still playing chess after the plane had crashed in Africa) You stay with us. We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.

Mason: Phil! I should wash your hands out with soap.

Gloria: How in the hello are they gonna fix this plane?!

Alex: You know, grit and spit and spit. A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.

Marty: That don't sound too promising.

Alex: You're right. We're stuck here.

Marty: Hey guys, as long as we're together, we'll be OK.

Alex: Yeah. Yeah. But love ain't gonna get us home, guys.

(The Tour Guide, who is wearing soft khaki pants, A Bill Winter long sleeve shirt, black socks and light brown shoes, pulls up in a jeep with pauristssengers.)

Tour Guide: Behold! The lion!

Alex: Hey, it's People!

Tour Guide: There is much to see. Moving on.

Wait, wait, wait! People!

They'll help us!

Wait up!

People! Stop!

Help us!

Alex: Hey, wait! If you stop, I'll autograph those!

Nana: I know you!

Alex: You.

Nana: It's the bad kitty!

(Nana uses her handbag to attack Alex as he throws her out of the jeep!)

Alex: Give me that!

(Alex karate yells and punches Nana)

Alex: How do you like some of that?!

(Nana punches Alex as Alex still fights Nana. And for a big hit, Alex spits his tooth, while Nana spits her chattering teeth.)

Nana: Ho, ho! Uno, dos, tres!!

(Nana uses a log to attack, but Alex deflects it and uses a rock.)

Alex: Ah-ha ha!

Nana: Come in, Tokyo!

(Nana uses a pinch on Alex as a rock drops on his head)

Alex: Yeow! Owww!!

(And Nana kicks Alex's butt, harassing Alex, and the people are cheering)

Marty: Right in the batteries!

Nana: You think an old lady can't take care of herself? (Puts her chattering teeth in her mouth) Next time, I won't go so easy on you! Thank you, dear.

Tour Guide: Moving on!

Gloria: (Not realizing that the old lady was the one who harassed Alex at Grand Central Station) Are you out of your mind?! We need their help, and you're harassing little old ladies!?

Alex: Out of my mind? Who's out of my mind now?

Marty: See if you can get an operator.

Alex: No problem. Out of my mind. We're going home.

Melman: Oh my... Whoa!

Gloria: Am I trippin'?

Marty: All those zebras... like me. Wait a minute, where are we?

Melman: San Diego. This time I'm 40 percent sure.

Alex: I know this place.

Marty: I think it's Africa.

Melman: Africa?

Marty: It's got to be. Our ancestral crib. It's in our blood. I can feel it!

Alex: No, it's more than that. It's like... ..déjà vu, like I've been here before.

Marty: It's like Roots!

Alex: No, it's like... .déjà vu, like I've been here before.

Alex: How! How! Me Alex! Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird. Then plummet! Smash ground! Go boom! Then here we emerge. We offer only happiness and good greetings.

Hippo: Is he mentioning about a plane crash?

Alex: Yeah. We just... yeah. I thought... Sorry.

Giraffe: You mean you came from off the reserve?

Alex: Yeah, way off. From the Central Park Zoo, actually.

[A loud roar caused the zoo animals to turn. It came from a male lion named Zuba. He coughed as he cleared his throat.]

Florrie: Don't strain yourself.

Zuba: What's going on here? What's all this hubbub?

Elephant: They say they're from off the reserve.

Zuba: That's impossible. Only people come from off the reserve.

Alex: You look familiar. Do I know you?

Zuba: How could you possibly survive the hunters?

Gloria: Hunters? We didn't see any hunters.

Zuba: What are you looking at?!

Alex: Me? Nothing.

Zuba: This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed. So skedaddle back to wherever you came from.

Alex: Okay. Well, Is there a manager we could talk to?

Zuba: Oh, I see. You're here to challenge me!

Alex: What? No! No.

Zuba: Well, that's what it looks like to me!

Florrie: Zuba! Wait.

Zuba: I'm trying to take care of business...

Florrie: Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on. Alakay? Is that you?

Alex: No, it's Alex. lx. Like New York Knicks.

Florrie: (Noticing the mark on Alex's paw) Zuba, look!

Alex: Oh. I've always had that. The vet checked it out. It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

Zuba: A mark.

Alex: All right, this is a little weird.

Zuba: Honey, he's come home.

Alex: What?

Zuba: You've come home.

Alex: (realizes that he still has his mark since he was a cub) Whoa!

Zuba: (realizing his son is still alive) Son.

Alex: Dad. Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad! Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad! I got a mom and dad!

Florrie: Our baby's alive!

Marty: (mistakes Alex's father on being his father too) Dad!

Zuba: My son! My son is home!

(All the animals are cheering)

Florrie: Alakay! Alakay has come home!

Makunga: Whoo!! Whoo! Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns. This is perfect!

Teetsi: (Yawns) I thought you hated Zuba.

Makunga: No, I do. I do. I do. I hate him. Oh, I do. And I'm going to use Alakay, yes. I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

Julien: Giddy-up, feathered horse! Make way!

Maurice: Make way! Move out of the way! Stand aside!

Julien: (Not realizing they are in Africa) New York! Hmm... It's a bit of a dump. Are you sure we're not in New Jersey? Hello, New Yorkers! Your new king is here!

Zuba: This calls for a celebration!

Julien: Maurice, I think they like me.

Maurice: You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!

Marty: Excuse me. I'm Marty. I'm kind of new around here.

Zebras: Hey, Marty!

Marty: You're a good-looking group! You like to run?

Zebras: Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

Marty: That's right! Crack-a-lackin'. You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.

[cut to the giraffes]

Melman: What? You don't have doctors here?

Giraffe: Not anymore.

Melman: Well, what if you catch a cold?

Giraffe: We go over to the dying holes and we die.

[Melman sees a Giraffe coughing]

Melman: Okay. You guys really need a doctor.

Giraffe: Hey. We have an opening.

Giraffe 2: Would you be interested?

Melman: Me? A doctor?

[Cut to the hippopotamuses]

Gloria: It's raining men. Hallelujah! You all got it going on.

Hippo: Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

Gloria: Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls. Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.

[Cut to the lions and lionesses]

Zuba: Hey, everybody! I just found out that my son here is a doggone king! The King of New York Show me some of your moves, son. Come on. Don't be bashful.

Alex: [confidently] All right. This one always knocks 'em dead. (does his zoo act) Roar!

Zuba: Look out. The King is mad. The King is mad! Now let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!

[cut back to the Zebras]

Zebras: Welcome to the herd, Marty!

Marty: Me? I've always wanted to be part of a herd!- It's one for all...

Zebras: And all for all, y'all!

Melman: How do I look?

Giraffe: Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.

Melman: Huh?

Giraffe 2: Don't worry... it's just a clip-on. Voilà! He's a witch doctor!

Melman: My mother will be so happy.

Girl Hippo: Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

Girl Hippo 2: Here he comes.

Moto Moto: Goodness, girl... you huge.

Gloria: Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

Moto Moto: Girl you as quick as you are hefty.

Gloria: So you're Moto Moto?

Moto Moto: The name's so nice, you say it twice.

Gloria: I kind of like it, fatso.

Moto Moto: I'll see you around, girl. It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.

[Alex was still having his crowd surf until he landed on the ground with his back]

Alex: Oof!

Makunga: Oops! (Chuckles) Um... I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the other lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.

Zuba: What are you talking about Makunga?

Makunga: It's nothing, really. They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

Zuba: I had forgot about the rite of passage.

Alex: What is it? What's this rite of passage?

Zuba: It's a traditional coming-of-age ceremony where young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.

Alex: Sort of a show-of-skill talent show deal?

Zuba: Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

Alex: Great! A performance! I think that's up my alley, guys. If it's tradition, I want to do it. Strut my stuff. Earn my mane. I want to be Alakai.

Florrie: Alakay.

Alex: Alakay! Even better.

Zuba: We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!

Makunga: That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

Alex: Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

Zuba: That's my boy!

Julien: [singing] Cause I'm a private dancer. A dancer for money. Any old music will do-- [passes out]

Gloria: Beautiful, isn't it?

Melman: Yeah.

Marty: It's amazing.

Alex: Guys....this is where we belong.

[Scene changes to the penguins, who are looking through a glass jar at a tour jeep]

Skipper: Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

Private: Oh, I like that one. That's a good one.

Kowalski: It works on many levels sir.

Skipper: You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

Kowalski: That too, sir.

Private: Absolutely.

Rico: Hai!

Skipper: Stations. Stage one. Go!

[Private runs to a red X on the ground and waddles in place. The tour jeep hits him, and he lands on the dirt. He then squirts ketchup on his stomach while cracking an egg on his head and placing a fake bone by his stomach, and then he sticks his tongue out to make it look like he is dead. The people that were in the tour jeep get out to check what happened]

Tour Guide: Oh, no! What have I done?

Skipper: Come on, take the bait.

Woman: What happened?

Man: What's going on?

Woman 2: Oh, look at the poor little guy.

Man: Is it dead?

Skipper: Stage two! Go, go, go!

Tour Guide: I will give him the kiss of life.

[The tour guide kisses Private, who inflates and flies into the tour jeep]

Skipper: Rico! Rico! Reverse! Gas! Music!

[Boston's "More than a Feeling" starts playing]

Tour Guide: No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Come back!

Nana: What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

[The penguins throw Nana out of the windshield]

Private: Is she dead?

[Nana gets up]

Skipper: No! (drives the car forward towards Nana)

Nana: (gets hit by the car) Oui! [gets up and straightens her head] You hoodlums! (She picks up her glasses)

Tour Guide: Good heavens! Are you OK?

Man 2: Lady, I found your pocketbook. (gives the purse to Nana)

Nana: My handbag. Such a good boy. Nana can't survive without it.

Cameraman: Wow. You are one tough cookie.

Nana: Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

Tour Guide: OK, nobody panic! The best thing we can do is stay together. We'll wait for another tour jeep. It may take hours, it's getting dark but...

Cameraman: Where are you going?

Nana: I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals. I'm too old to die.

Cameraman: I don't know about you guys but I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

Tour Guide: Please! We need to stay.....together. Fine! We'll go that way!

Nana: Does anyone want a hard candy?

(Back with Alex and his parents)

Florrie: Easy now.

Zuba: Watch your step. And right here... OK, are you ready? This is where you always slept.

Alex: Oh, man! Wow. Was this mine?

Zuba: Look at you. Look at him.

Alex: Oh, this thing. Look, look! I remember this!

Zuba: He remembers.

Alex: A little harder than...

Zuba: You never slept on the right end. You always slept on the bottom end.

Alex: Is that? Is that my? Is that me?

Florrie: You had the cutest little paws.

Zuba: Little, little bitty ol' paws.

Florrie: You did that the day we lost you.

Alex: Wow. I was so young. What happened to me?

Zuba: It was all my fault. I turned my back a minute and...

Florrie: It was not your fault. Your father did everything he could. He tracked those hunters for weeks. Far off the reserve.

Zuba: Finally, I had to assume the hunters....well...

Florrie: We thought they'd killed you.

Zuba: But my son fought them off! Don't mess with the King of New York!

Alex: That's right!

Zuba: Keep your chin in.

Florrie: Alright. You boys be careful! Now watch out before you break something. You used to call this "foofie."

Alex: "Foofie"? Foofie.

Zuba: He doesn't want that.

(Zuba grabs the Foofie away from Alex)

Alex: This is my foofie!

Florrie: Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

Alex: I mean, no, thank you, thank you. It's perfect.

Zuba: Son, you get your rest. You have a big day tomorrow. You'll gonna need all your strength.

Alex: I will bring the house down for you.

Florrie: I hope so. Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.

Alex: Jeez, Mom, really?

Zuba: I know you'll do us proud. You know why? You were born with it. Good night, Alakay. My boy. My own boy. My son's a king. My son's a king.

Alex: Good night, Mom.

Florrie: Good night, Alakay.

Alex: Foofie. Look at foofie! My foofie! Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

[From the jungle, the humans are getting lost and were tired.]

Cameraman: No sign of civilization. Everybody appears very tired. I think we're lost. Hey Nana, do you know where you're going?

Nana: No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.

Cameraman: Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

[A rustle in the bushes caused them to stop and look. Some more people came out from the opposite direction.]

Man: Oh, It's people.

Man: Where did you come from?

Woman: How did you get out here?

Man 2: How did you get here?

Cameraman: Can you help us? We're lost.

Man: We're lost too.

Woman: It was awful. A flash of black and white and they were gone. They took the jeep!

Man: That happened to our jeep too!

Man 3: What do we do?

Man 4: How will we all survive?

Cameraman: We got nothing. No food, no water, no shelter. What are we gonna do?!

Nana: (Whistles) You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature. Gather 'round, children. We're New Yorkers, right?

All: Yeah.

Nana: We survive the concrete jungle! When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand. Am I right?

Man: She's right.

Nana: When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.

Man: Exactly!

Nana: When we need water, we build a dam.

Man: Come on, We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

Nana: If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!

(cut to the beach)

Mort: I'm coming, King Julien! [he starts to sing before he gets attack by a shark and runs off] Bad fishy! Bad fishy! No, shark, no! Sit! Why am I laughing?

(cut to the Penguins with their jeeps)

Kowalski: Skipper, we have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.

Skipper: How slightly?

Kowalski: Uh, Six to nine years.

Skipper: Sixty-nine years?

Kowalski: No, six to nine years.

Skipper: Private! What happened to our thumbs?

Private: Haven't seen them since yesterday, sir. [He drops the screwdriver that's in his hands] Darn you, Darwin!

Skipper: Nobody goes AWOL on my watch. Private! You're coming with me. (The engine Private gets stuck in explodes) Rico! You're coming with me! We'll track them down and bring them in for court martial.

Mason: That won't be necessary! We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

(Thousands of chimps are here; Skipper is in awe, and Private lands behind him.)

Skipper: Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

Mason: Oh, I doubt that.

Skipper: Enough lollygagging. Now let's get to work. We'll divide into three groups. Group Alpha, you're in charge for sheet metal fabrication. Group Bronson, you handle the assembly. Group George Peppard, you'll handle craft services. Any questions? (Mason attempts to ask one, but is cut off) Good! Now let's get to work. I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

Mason: Oh, all right, but you're so darn ugly.


Alex: Alright so, little cub scouts, just remember great dance performance comes from the heart. Comes straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.

Cub: Sure, mister.

Makunga: Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck you're not nervous, are you?

Alex: Nah, it's my thing. You know It's kinda what I do.

Makunga: In my opinion, the key to this whole thing is choosing the right competitor.

Alex: Oh. You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing? Like a dance-off?

Makunga: Uh... Sure.

Alex: Great. I love that. Freestyle. Put your moves off. Who'd be a good match for me? You know just to keep things interesting.

Makunga: Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all that we all we hold sacred. But if it was me out there... I'd choose Teetsi.

Alex: Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting. Makunga, right? Thank you.

Makunga: Anything for Zuba's boy. Go get 'em, tiger.

Alex: Shake it out. A five, six, seven, eight. Let's go, let's do this.

Zuba: Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.

Florrie: Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!

Zuba: Woman, I'm trying to take...

Alex: On it, Mom!

Zuba: So who will be the first participant?

Alex: Me! Oh! Me, me, me! Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

Zuba: How about you? The tall, handsome one. Yeah. Choose your opponent.

Alex: Let me see. Hmm. Ah! I guess I'll pick...

[Makunga looks left and right to see if anyone is watching him, then winks at Alex cunningly]

Alex: Teetsi?

[Everyone except Makunga gasps in shock]

Florrie: [shocked] Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

Zuba: Oh, that's my boy! He's got some gumption there! Somebody, wake him up! Wake him up.

(A lion throws a rock on Teetsi's head as it's laying on a rock! Teetsi burst his eyes open and roars before proceeding to rise up, revealing his towering height and unseathing his claws. His muscles pop out starting from his legs, through his torso all the way up to his upper body and he lets out a ferocious roar.)

Alex: All right, so, Teetsi, come on. Let's do this, huh? Come on, little tsetse fly. Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

Teetsi: Let's dance!

Alex: OK. But let me warn you that I am a protégé of....Fosse and Robbins!

Teetsi: Not "dance" dance! Fight!

Alex: Dance fight! You got it.

[Alex started dancing. Zuba and Florrie were confused.]

Florrie: Is he dancing?

Zuba: What is he doing?

Florrie: I know that boy is not dancing.

Makunga: [trying to hold his laugh] This is even better than I thought.

(Alex still dancing as Teetsi roars and unleashes his claws!)

Zuba: Alakay, turn around!

Alex: No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.

(Alex's pupils shrink in shock as he turns around to face Teetsi flying towards him with both fists extended. Teetsi slams Alex with such force that the whole savanna shakes and alarge fissure travels beyond the Lions' arena, cracking a small boulder and alerting a small herd of antelopes.)

Zuba: Oh, no.

Florrie: Alakay! Are you hurt?

Alex: Oh. Yeah, I am. Did I, uh... did I win?

Zuba: Oh no, son. How could, I mean... How could this happen? You told us you were a king. And a king does not get beat.

Alex: Well, I am a king. I'm a... I'm the King of New York. It's... It's my stage name. I'm like, uh... you know, it's uh... for when I perform.

Zuba: Perform?

Makunga: (showing no regrets for his own actions) Oh, no, this is horrible! Alakay has failed the test! Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish... (inhales sharply) …his own son?

Florrie: Zuba, no.

Makunga: Zuba, yes. Sadly, the Alpha Lion must cast out all failures.

Zuba: (looks to his son and thinks about the consequences of banishing his son and decides to resign his title) Then I'm no longer the Alpha lion. (throws the staff)

Alex: Dad, what are you doing? Dad, no! You can't do this!

Makunga: Who could possibly take Zuba's place? Anyone? Someone? No one?

Random Lion: Hey!

Makunga: (Accidentally hits another lion) You, sir! I guess not. Well, I... This is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.

Zuba: Hmph.

Makunga: Teetsi! Get the hat.

(Teetsi picks up the fruit hat and walks to Alex)

Makunga: As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay! He shall wear this hat of shame, and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life! Whichever comes last.

(Zuba glares at Makunga. Alex and his parents have relocated to a barren land overrun by dik-dik antelope.)

Zuba: (shooing the antelope) Come on! Shoo, shoo! Get out of here! (to Alex) You should have told us, son. You should have told us that you weren't a real king!

Alex: You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!

Zuba: What did you expect, son?!

Alex: I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

Zuba: You're a lion aren't you?

Alex: But I never fought another lion!

Zuba: No, I guess not. You dance!

Alex: And other stuff! The point is your pal, Makunga, set me up back there! I mean, none of this would have happened...

Zuba: If you were a real lion.

Florrie: (scolding Zuba) ZUBA!!

Zuba: Yeah, I said it!

Alex: A real lion. Thanks. Thanks a lot. (Leaves his parents behind)

(Zuba and Florrie glare at each other)

Melman: Saw. Suture. Swab. You're in my light, Stephen.

Stephen: Ooh! Say, you've got a brown spot there on your shoulder.

Melman: Yes, that's very observant, Stephen. As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots. OK! That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.

Timo: So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?

Melman: No, Timo, you got your whole life ahead of you.

Timo: Really?

Melman: Go out there and grab it by the horns!

Timo: Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!

Melman: Break a leg! Sweet kid.

Stephen: Um... (Clears throat) This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.

Melman: (Scoffs) Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of Stephen. Whoa!

Elephant: Don't ask.

Melman: Someone's been knotty. (Chuckles) Okay. This won't hurt a bit.

Giraffe: Joe, our last witch doctor. He had a spot just like that.

Melman: Mmm-hmm. And?

Giraffe: Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

Melman: Wednesday, no Joe?

[Melman fixes the elephant's nose]

Elephant: Oh, I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

Melman: So, this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?

Giraffe: You'll find a cure. Hey! You've got at least 48 hours!

Melman: But I've never even heard of it. I mean... I don't have any penicillin. I'm gonna need a CAT scan just to get started!

Giraffe: We'll have a lion look you over. They'd be happy to.

[Marty does the water challenge like he did in the first film, spits out water, and sprays it all over the zebras]

Marty: Ta-da!

Zebras: He has talent! Stupendous and tremendous! Hollah!

Marty: Bet you've never seen that one before! Knocked 'em dead in New York!

Zebra: Hey, let's all give it a try!

Zebras: Let's do it!

Marty: Well, you can try all you want to, but it's gonna takes years of practice. And you'll never gonna quite get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this. You got it?

[The zebras do the same thing like Marty did, but there was more water, which made Marty scream and knocked him]

Zebras: Ta-da!

Marty: How did you...? You guys got it right out of the box!

Zebra: If you can do it, we can do it.

Zebra #2: It's in our blood!

Marty: I always thought I was a bit unique.

Zebras: We are unique!

Zebra: Hey! We are like a force of nature!

Zebra 2: A million points of light!

Zebra 3: And dark stripes!

Zebras: Exactly the same!

Marty: Exactly the same.

Skipper: Looks impressive, Kowalski, but... will it fly?

Kowalski: Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

Skipper: Nice.

Alex: Oh, man. My dad thinks I'm a total loser. I've ruined my parents' lives.

Zebra: That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

Alex: It is lackin' in the crackin', my friend. I've gotta fix this.

Melman: So....there's... There's something I gotta tell you.

Gloria: Hey, guys. Is this place great or what?!

Alex: I'd go with "or what."

Gloria: Oh Well, I'll tell you what. You're not gonna believe it, but... Ha! I got a date with Moto Moto. (chuckles)

Melman: Who's Moto Moto?

Gloria: Oh, he's so big and handsome and big! You know what "Moto Moto" means?

Melman: Twins?

Zebra: It means, "Hot Hot."

Melman: "Hot Hot"?

Gloria: OK. When did you start parlez-ing African?

Zebra: It's in my blood.

Melman: Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

Gloria: What's the deal Melman? Why am I the parade and you're the rain?

Melman: Why do you have to drive your parade under my rain?

Gloria: Maybe I'll just parade myself in another part of town!

Alex: Whoa, guys. Guys!

Melman: Fine by me by the way. Main Street's mine!

Gloria: Well, you can have your old stinking main street!

Melman: And you can take your hotee-tot float and your Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

Zebra: What are we talking about?

Alex: Melman, why don't you just tell her?

Melman: You tell her?! What? Tell her? What are you talking... I don't know what you're talking about.

Gloria: So I guess I'll go, then.

Melman: You know what? Don't bother.

Gloria: Well, don't get up on my account.

Alex: Melman! Gloria!

Zebra: Hey! I-I thought you guys were friends!

Alex: Come on guys. Marty's absolutely right.

Zebra: Marty?

[Suddenly, the real Marty shows up.]

Marty: Marty?

Alex: Marty?

Marty: What the heck is going on?

Alex: You're not? Oh! He was... No! I thought he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

Marty: You thought that guy...was me?

Alex: No, no! No! I mean, yes! Yes, you do... Guys, come on.

Zebra: You thought I was him?

Alex: You guys kind of do look a little... You look a lot alike. Marty, you look a lot alike. Come on! You laugh alike. You talk alike. He has the same sort of speech pattern. I mean, it's a little weird, really. You guys are... I mean, come on. Marty.

Marty: So, you're saying there's nothing unique about me. I'm just like any other zebra.

Alex: No. Of course you're different!

Both: How?

Alex: Okay! OK, I can't tell you apart. Maybe you could wear a bell or something? I don't know.

Marty: A bell?

Alex: OK, not a bell. No, bell's a bad idea.

Marty: No, no, no! How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid?!"

Zebra: I'm not stupid.

Marty: Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

Alex: You know what? While you've been off doing the prancing pony with your new posse, I've been having pretty much the worst day of my life. Okay?

Marty: (sighs) It's always about you, isn't it?

Alex: My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours, Marty. Alright, I couldn't tell you apart. So what?! (sees one of the two zebras leaving) Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away! That's what you do best! Just like back in New York!

Marty: I'm right here. But you can't tell that, right?

(Alex groans in frustration, mistaking the two zebras)

Marty: Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!

Alex: Good! Leave! I don't need you to help solve my problems! You know what, you're a dime a dozen, I can't tell which one's Marty! Oh, which one's Marty? Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh, yeah! I don't care!

Zebra: Nice hat, you showoff!

Alex: Marty.....don't go.

Julien: Giddy-up, giddy-up! Look, Maurice! Here's the perfect spot for my summer palace! So please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff. Oh. Who'd leave a perfectly good head?

Maurice: What a waste.

Melman: Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here. I'm terminal, you know? I probably only have another two days left to live.

Maurice: That's a bummer, man.

King Julien: If I, King Julien... that's my name....only had two days left to live, I would do all the things I've ever dreamed of doing.

Melman: Like what?

King Julien: I'd love to become a professional whistler. I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it. [raspberries] You know what else I would do? I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!

Melman: Easy for you to say. You're a king.

King Julien: Yes. And you are only just a sad little head. There must be something you want to do before you die!

Melman: Well, there is this one thing.

Julien: What? Tell me.

Melman: No, I couldn't.

Julien: What is it?

Melman: You know, I never told Gloria how I feel about her.

Julien: What is it? Please tell me!

Melman: I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her. How I've always felt about her.

Julien: Fine. Don't tell me! Oh...Is it a woman? You didn't tell me it's a woman.

Maurice: What are you afraid of? You're a dead man anyway.

Melman: Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

Julien: Well, you've got to march right up to this woman. Look her right in the eye. Lean forward. Just a little, or almost all the way. Then you let her lean forward a little until you're....just lips' distance away from each other. Then you tell her how much you hate her.

Melman: Actually, it's more like love her.

Julien: Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof! You're a real player. Now listen to me. You got to rise up. You hearing me?

Maurice: He didn't hear you.

Julien: I can't hear you!

Melman: Yeah.

Julien: Good. You got to rise up!

Maurice: Rising up!

Julien: You're gonna get out of the hole!

Melman: I'm rising out of the ground!

Julien: He's rising, Maurice.

Maurice: I'm rising, Maurice!

Maurice: Rising!

Julien: You go right up to this woman!

Maurice: Do you feel it?

Julien: Go up to her face!

Maurice: Tell the truth!

Melman: I'm going to tell her!

Julien: And then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

Melman: Yeah! I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it!

Julian: I love that happy little head.

Moto Moto: [singing] She loves me She loves my eyes, She loves me She loves my thighs, She loves my roundness, She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy, She love my heftiness She love my zestiness She love me restlessly She love me forever She love me... ..'cause she love me

Gloria: Moto Moto...before things get too serious, well, I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here... l'd like to ask you...

Moto Moto: Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.

Gloria: Well I don't know. I have so many questions.

Moto Moto: Well I promise the answer will always be yes. Unless no is required.

Gloria: Okay. So what is it about me that you find so interesting?

Moto Moto: You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.

Gloria: OK. Other than that.

Moto Moto: Let's see. Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

Gloria: Right.

Moto Moto: My gosh, girl, you huge.

Gloria: You said that.

Moto Moto: Yeah, that's right. We don't have to talk no more.

[From the forests. Melman appeared]

Melman: Gloria! Gloria.

Gloria: Melman. Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

Melman: Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you. Well I guess I...

Gloria: It's OK, Melman. Apology accepted.

Melman: Oh. Yeah, right, that. That's why I... Good. OK. Well, that's it, then.

Moto Moto: You're good. We're kind of busy here, man.

Melman: No. No, that's not it. (pulls Moto Moto from Gloria) Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen. Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman. If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman, I'd would give her flowers every day. And not just any flowers. OK? Her favorites are orchids. White. And breakfast in bed. Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides. No crust, the way she likes it. I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend. I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh. She has the most amazing laugh. That's what I would do if I were you. But I'm not, so you do it.

Moto Moto: OK. What?

Hippo: That was beautiful.

Moto Moto: Anyways, where were we?

Gloria: I'm "huge"?

[The next morning, Alex is tilting his head angrily as if he was breaking the fourth wall.]

Alex: Surprised to see me, Makunga? Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion! Is this real enough for you? How about this? This is for setting me up! This is for stealing my dad's job! This is for humiliating my family! And making me look like a fool!

[The nest has the birds come out and they attack Alex while he spits some of them with its feathers]

Alex: Had enough? Sure, fly away! Coward.

[But then, Alex heard someone screamed in horror. He goes over and saw that the watering hole was all gone. The animals have gathered there and sees a fish, asking about where the water is.]

Fish: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Giraffe: The water. It's gone.

Giraffe 2: Oh no.

Hippo: The watering hole is never gone dry before.

Giraffe: We're gonna need a lot more dying holes.

Bobby: How could this happen?

Makunga: Out of my way! WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!?!?!

Bobby: The watering hole's dried up! There's barely enough water for one of us!

Makunga: Yes. Good observation, Shirley.

Bobby: I'm Bobby.

Giraffe: Makunga, what do we do?

Makunga: QUIET!!! Listen up! I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis: We'll all have to fight for it.

Hippo: Fight for it? We can't fight for it.

Cape Buffalo: That's crazy.

Bobby: That's not fair. You'd win!

Makunga: Exactly, Shirley.

Bobby: I'm Bob...

[Before Bobby can finish, Makunga kicks him up, shocking the other animals.]

Makunga: Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair. I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

Timo: Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.

Makunga: If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.

Animals: Off the reserve?! It's too dangerous! Hunters would shoot us! No one leaves the reserve and survives!

[But then, as the animals talk, Alex looks back and remembered how he left the reserve when he got caught and was later put in the crate by the hunters when he was a little cub while Zuba tried to rescue him.]

Alex: I left the reserve! And survived. I can do something about this. Looks like a clogged pipe. Like we get in New York all the time. I'll just travel upriver...

Animals: Upriver? Off the reserve?

Makunga: You? [laughing]

Alex: Yeah! Me! I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.

Makunga: Great! I'd help you pack; but the looks of that hat, I see you're all set! [laughing]

Alex: Yeah. Fine. Go ahead. Laugh! Laugh your mane off! I'm gonna prove you wrong.

Makunga: Maybe you should try a little rain dance.

[Alex leaves to find his friend Marty, as Makunga scatting and laughed. Then one of the animals spoke knowing why Makunga never cared to the world of being a bad king like his inspiration Scar.]

Giraffe: Zuba would know what to do.

Giraffe 2: Where's Zuba!?

Elephant: You don't care about us!

Hippo: Zuba should be in charge, not you.

[The Animals start clamoring to find Zuba]

Makunga: (growls) ALL RIGHT!!! Fine! As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!

[Meanwhile, Alex goes off to find Marty.]

Alex: Marty? Hey! Marty! Marty? Marty.

Zebra: Where'd you get the fruity hat?

Alex: Excuse me! Excuse me! Hi. Is Marty in there?

Zebras: Marty? Anyone seen Marty? Which one of us is Marty?

Alex: All right. Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.

Zebra: Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going Can we come?

Alex: No. This is something I have to do this alone.

Zebras: You can't leave the reserve! What are you doing? They'll get your hat. Hunters are everywhere! Could you leave the hat?

Alex: Marty, Look! I know you're in there. Before I go, I got something I want to say. You've been a great friend. You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you is having any. I wasn't there for you when you needed me. Just like back at the zoo. What kind of friend does that make me? A pretty lousy friend, I guess. Well I just want you to know that I... You're one in a million.

Zebra: This is touching.

{Another Zebra starts sobbing)

Zebra: It is touching.

Alex: So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face? That's right. Gotcha! I see you in there! Yeah, you. You, right there. Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left. That's you, Marty. I know it's you. Know what makes you special? These guys are white with black stripes. You're black with white stripes. You're a dreamer, Marty. Always have been. You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends. Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

Marty: OK, I'm in.

Alex: No, Marty. You can't come with me.

Marty: I don't believe you have a choice.

(Alex and Marty, reunited, walk side by side into the jungle, bumping each other playfully)

Zebras: People are out there! You're crazy! Come back! The people will get you! Don't lose the hat! Bye, hat!

(back at the dry hole, digging up)

Gloria: Any water?!

Moto Moto: No, just more diamonds and gold.

Gloria: Okay. Don't give up hope.

Julien: Listen up! I will help you! There's only one way to get your precious water. I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!

Rhino: What does that do?

Julien: What does that do? Excellent question. My sacrifice goes in the volcano. The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice. "Very nice. Thank you for the sacrifice." "Here, have another sacrifice." "No, I've had enough." " Listen I'm gonna insulted unless you have another." "I don't want another sacrifice okay?!" "Look at you! You look skinny!" "No! I've had enough! Is that clear?!" The gods eat the sacrifice. They are grateful. They give me some water, and then I give it to you.

Gloria: What?

Female Okapi: Does it work?

King Julien: No! I mean, yes. Well, Maurice?

Maurice: Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

All: We'll do it!

Julien: Excellent! Now, all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods. Any hands! Hands, anybody! Okay, I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

Melman: I'll do it.

Gloria: Melman?

(The crowd cheered and they carry Melman to the volcano chanting his name)

Julien: Hurry up! Before we all come to our senses!

Gloria: Melman, what is wrong with you?

Melman: I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance it'll get you water, it'll be worth it.

Gloria: Are you nuts?

Melman: Gloria, I just want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going. It was always you. Seeing you every day, that's what kept me going.

Gloria: Melman! Wait!

(With Alex’s parents)

Florrie: You going to mope around like this all day?

Zuba: Hmph.

Florrie: Don't "hmph" me. Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened. Our son has come back to us. How come that is not good enough for you?

Zuba: What are you saying, woman?

Florrie: We lost him once, Zuba. Let's not lose him again.

Makunga: Zuba! Zuba!

Zuba: Get out of here!

Florrie: What do you want, Makunga?

Makunga: It's awful. The watering hole is dried up.

Zuba: DRIED UP?! [growls] That's impossible!!

Makunga: There's nothing left!

Zuba: Well! You're alpha lion, Makunga. What are you gonna do about it?

Makunga: Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it. He's gone upriver.

Zuba: Off The Reserve?!

Florrie: No!

Makunga: I tried to stop him! I told him it was suicide, but he was determined to prove himself to you!

Zuba: You stay here, in case he comes back!

Makunga: Hurry, Zuba! I'm so parched. (coughs)

[In the woods, Alex and Marty go to look for the clog.]

Marty: Is this place starting to freak you out?

Alex: We'll slip in, find the problem. Hunters will never know we were here.

Marty: Why are we doing this?

Alex: Look. Marty, maybe my dad will think I'm... I just want to show him I'm a real lion.

Marty: As opposed to a chocolate lion?

Alex: Shh. I know this may sound hard to believe; but apparently, lions don't dance.

Marty: [shocked] WHAT?!?

Alex: SHH!! As far as my dad is concerned.

Marty: As far as people are concerned, you're a huge hit.

Alex: That was New York. This is Africa. It’s a much tougher crowd. Marty! Marty, this is it! This is the clog! Come on.

Marty: Well, there's the water.

(Marty drinks some of the water. While Marty is drinking the water, Alex notices Nana)

Alex: Marty, stay down. Look at that.

Nana: Knit one, purl two.

Alex: It's her.

Man: Is this right?

Nana: Very good.

Man: Nana, slow down.

Nana: You're a little tangled, aren't you? No, don't pull. I'll do it.

Alex: We need dynamite. Got any dynamite?

Marty: (loudly) Oh, snap! I just used my last stick this morning!

[Alex tells to quiet down, but an arrow hits the fruit hat of shame 🏹]

Marty: Savages!

Alex: Evasive maneuvers!

Marty: Serpentine, serpentine!

Alex: Squiggly squid maneuver!

Marty: Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

Alex: No, no! Squiggly squid!

Marty: Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

Alex: That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

Marty: Alex!

Alex: Run, Marty!

Marty: Come on, I can't leave you here!

Alex: Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver! Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

Marty: ETCH A SKETCH!!! ETCH A SKETCH!!!

[The camera changes to the volcano where Melman is about to go into the lava, but he is looking to the deep of the volcano.]

Melman: OK. OK, OK, OK. OK, here we go. OK, OK. Here we go! Here we go!

Joe: What's all the hoopla about?

Giraffe: Joe?

Giraffe 2: Joe the Witch Doctor? We thought you were dead!

Joe: So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.

Giraffe: So, Melman's not dying! [suddenly realizing the truth] Melman's not dying!

Giraffe 1: Oh, no!

Gloria: Excuse me! Melman!! Move! Don't do this! Julien, stop this! This is crazy!

King Julien: Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!

Gloria: Yes! Please, Melman! STOOOP!!!!

Melman: Gloria?

Gloria: You can't do this!

Melman: Why not?

Gloria: Because...Oh!

[But as she could finish, she trips which causes cracks to come out, Melman is shocked at what he's seeing, he runs up, but begins to fall. Gloria stops him from falling]

Gloria: You can't do this, Melman.

Melman: First of all, that hurts. Second of all, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.

Gloria: Melman, I gotta know...did you really mean those things you said about me?

Melman: Of course I did.

Gloria: That's crazy.

Melman: It is?

Gloria: It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world... to find out that the perfect guy for me lived right next door.

Melman: Then I guess it's you and me, neighbor. You and me for the next 18 hours.

Gloria: I'll take whatever you got.

(They embrace)

Julien: Maurice, what just happened?!

Maurice: I believe the fat lady has sung.

[As Melman and Gloria enjoyed their romance, Marty showed up to warn them about Alex]

Marty: Hey! What's going on here?

Gloria: Marty!

Marty: Hey. Hey. Listen up. Alex is in big trouble! We got to get upriver fast!

Melman: What about the plane?

Marty: Perfect! Come on!

[Meanwhile, the chimps are going on strike and protesting]

Mason: The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands. Now, about maternity leave.

Skipper: Maternity leave? [checks the chimps’s privates] You're all males.

Marty: Look, we need that plane for a rescue mission.

Skipper: Well, there's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.

Gloria: I'm gonna get the bustin' up all of you if you don't get this plane going!

Skipper: Can't you see these commies have my hands tied here? No maternity leave!

Mason: Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna? Hmm? [Phil shows 3 pictures of Skipper and Lola the Doll]

Skipper: All right. You get your maternity leave.

[The whistle blows]

Marty: Finally!

[Back in the woods, the hunters have tied up Alex and are gonna kill him and eat him as their dinner]

Alex: Where we headed? What's going on? Where are we going? Oh, no! Please! No, you're not gonna put me there! No, no, no! This is wrong.

Nana: You see? You are survivors. Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

Tour Guide: You can't eat a lion.

Nana: Eh. Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

Alex: No, no, no. Don't listen to her. She's out of her mind, people! Hey! Hey! I'm from New York City too! It's me, Alex the lion! From Central Park!

[Suddenly, the hunters hear a roaring. It revealed to be Zuba!]

Alex: Dad!

Zuba: What were you thinking, son?! You got no business being out here!! This is it. I want you to stay behind me.

Alex: No, Dad. They're New Yorkers. They're just rude and frightened people.

Zuba: Stay back! [snarls]

Nana: You'd let your dinner get away?!

Zuba: What are you doing, son?

Alex: The only thing I know how to do.

Tour Guide: Huh?

♪I've been around the world in the pourin' rain♪

Man: What the...?

♪Feelin' out of place, I'm feelin' strange♪

♪Take me to a place where they know my name♪

♪Where everyone knows my name♪

Cameraman: (recognizes the dance moves) Hey! I know those moves. Alex?

♪Check it, check it out, I'm 'bout to do my thing♪

[The hunters begin to notice that it is Alex the Lion]

Woman: It's Alex the lion!

♪King of the floor, king of the swing♪

Man: From the Central Park!

Man 2: It is Alex!

Man 3: Only one lion can move like that!

♪Play a little beat, I'll be your dance machine♪

♪Play a little jam, I'll come alive, alive, alive♪

Tour Guide: He's beautiful.

Zuba: I can't believe it.

♪Play that jungle fever, show 'em some love!♪

♪Show love♪

Man: How does he do that?!

(All the hunters start cheering)

♪This is my home♪

♪This is my home♪

♪King of the throne♪

♪This is my home♪

♪This is my home♪

♪This is my home♪

♪This is my home♪

[The hunters chant Alex's name while Zuba joins the dance for a relationship]

Alex: Dad, what are you doing?

Zuba: I'm dancing with my son! I think.

♪See, I've been travelin', been travelin' forever♪

Alex: Don't think, Dad. Feel! Butterfly!

♪But now that I found a home, feels like I'm in heaven♪

♪See, I've been travelin', been travelin' forever♪

Zuba: I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

♪But now that I'm home, feels like I'm in heaven♪

Both: ROAR!!!!!

(Everyone is cheering for Alex and Zuba and they drop the weapons)

Nana: Ohh. That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

Alex: Dad, look out!

[Nana shoots the gun. But the bullet is blocked by a bucket, which was connected by a chimp chain to the chimp plane.]

Zuba: What the...?

Marty: Alex! Get in!

Alex: She's got a gun! Let's get out while we can!

Marty: (unable to hear) What?!

Alex: [To the first chimp on the chain] "She's got a gun! Let's get out while we can!" Pass it on!

(The chimps relay the message to Mason)

Mason: (Unable to understand what the monkeys said) He said, “Let’s have some fun and take out the dam. Basset hound!”

Marty: Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam!

Skipper: All right! But it's his funeral.

Marty: What?

Skipper: Hard to port!

Gloria: Aye-aye, Skippy!

Melman: Bring it on! Bring it on! Whoo!

Alex and Zuba: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Nana: Come back! That's my dinner!

Skipper: Kowalski, full throttle. Music!

Private: (Puts the music of Copacabana by Barry Manilow) Ooh! I like this song.

Kowalski: It never gets old.

Skipper: It does have a catchy tune. Come about! Bring her in low! Hold onto your skirts! It's dam-busting time!

Gloria: Whoo! Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

Alex: Tell them "No! Pull up! They'll kill us! There's got to be another way!" Pass it on!

(The chimps relay another message to Mason)

Mason: (not recognizing what they said) They say no pull up, kill us. there is no other way, Basset hound!

Marty: Are you sure?

Skipper: Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's. (Nana shoots Lola's head) No!! MEDIC!!!! Ramming speed!!!

(Alex and Zuba screaming)

Nana: Bring it on!

(Marty screams as Gloria and Melman are whooping and Alex and Zuba still screaming before they crash the dam)

Nana: Bad kitties.

[And the dam is now crushed and the water now has freedom to save the Circle of Life!]

(Cuts to the volcano)

Julien: I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work. The science seemed so solid. I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.

Mort: Oh! It's you! I found you!

King Julien: (confused) Mort?

Mort: [laughing then screams after he sees the shark still chasing him] Bad fishy!

Julien and Maurice: AHHHH!!!

[The shark falls into the lava]

Maurice: Whoa. I wonder if the gods like seafood.

Julien: Let's find out. Look, Maurice.

Maurice: That was quick.

Julien: I did it! I did it! I did it! (Volcano roars in eruption) OK, you did it!

Mort: Oh, yes!!!!

Hippo: Look!

Animals: It's Alakay! It's Zuba! You did it! Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

Florrie: Zuba! Alakay! You're back! I'm so glad you're safe!

Makunga: Out of my way. Well, well, well, well, well. You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride. And you were kicked out. So don't think for an instant that this changes anything.

Alex: You're right. In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation. It's a man bag. Very popular where I come from.

Makunga: I don't know what to say.

Alex: You can still be tough and carry your stuff!

Makunga: My, does the strap adjust? Yes. I think this will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking! But I'm afraid you're still banished.

Alex: We figured you'd say that.

(Zuba pulls down the bucket, revealing that Nana was inside it)

Nana: My handbag! You bad kitty!

(Nana kicks Makunga's nuts, steps on his foot, uses her ruler to hit his hand, wet willies his left ear and rubs his right arm. The animals cheer at Makunga getting his karma.)

Makunga: No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

(And Nana spanks Makunga's butt)

Makunga: ARGH!!!!

Alex: Ow!

(And Nana takes Makunga back to her camp so that she and her hunters can take him back to New York or cook him alive.)

Zuba: You deserve this, son. Welcome to the pride.

Alex: Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

Zuba: No! No, son. To us! (crowd celebrating in victory) My son! The King of New York!

Florrie: That's my baby!

[Scene cuts to the wedding day where Skipper and his doll girlfriend get married]

Zuba: Love transcends all differences. We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love. Do you take each other, for better or for worse?

Skipper: For better, please.

Alex: What a beautiful, weird couple!

Melman: That's not going to last.

Private: Can I kiss the bride, Skipper?

Skipper: No! Music!

(More than a Feeling by Boston plays again)

Skipper: Struts.

Kowalski: Check.

Skipper: Flaps!

Kowalski: Check.

Skipper: Diamonds and gold.

Kowalski: Check.

Florrie: Bye-bye!

Zuba: We'll miss you!

Florrie: See you later!

Skipper: We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.

Zuba: Take care yourself!

Florrie: Come back soon!

Alex: You know Mom, let them take their time. New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

Marty: Yeah! You're right about that!

Melman: As long as I'm with her... and you two, I don't care where we are. She has the most amazing laugh.

Marty: Love has no boundaries!

Alex: Well, looks like you're stuck with us for a while. Dad? What's wrong? I just thought we could hang out a bit and...

(Zuba makes faces of angry and happy, then he laughs)

Marty: Hey!

Alex: You got me!

Zuba: I got you, son! (Scatting)

Alex: You got me with. You did my thing. You brought it back around on me. I love it.

Zuba: (Scatting) I got you, son!

Alex: The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

Marty: Marty? Who's Marty?

Alex: Come on!

Marty: I don't know no Marty. No call me Marty.

Alex: You can't fool me!

Marty: I don't see no Marty. Ain't no Marty here.

Alex: Marty! I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
