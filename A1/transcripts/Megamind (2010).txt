    (We start out in the sunset sky)
    Megamind (voiceover): Here's my day so far; went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams, and got my butt kicked pretty good. Still, things could be a lot worse. Oh, that's right, I'm falling to my death. Guess they can't. How'd it all come to this, you ask? My end starts at the beginning. The very beginning. (fade to white, then to baby Megamind.) Yes, that's me. I had a fairly standard childhood. I came from what you might call a broken home, literally broken. I was eight days old and still livin' with my parents. How sad is that? Clearly it was time to move on.
    Megamind's Mother: Here is your Minion, he will take care of you.
    Megamind's Father: And here is your binky. (He puts the binky into Megamind's mouth and then utters his last words to his son.) You are destined for...
    (The ship closes and starts to take off.)
    Megamind: [voice over] I didn't quite hear that last part, but it sounded important. Destined for... what? I set out to find my destiny. Turns out a kid from the Glaupunk Quadrant had the exact same idea. That was the day I met Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes. And our glorious rivalry, was born!
    (baby Megamind's ship is heading towards a large beautiful house.)
    Megamind: [voice over] Could this be what I was destined for? A dream life filled with luxury?
    (baby Metro Man’s ship collides with Megamind's and bounces and slides into the beautiful house.)
    Megamind: (voice-over.) Apparently not! Even fate picks its favorites. No big deal. A much different fate awaited me.
    (Megamind's ship lands in Metro City Prison.)
    Lady Scott: A baby! How thoughtful. (holds infant Metro Man in her hands.)
    Lord Scott: (reading his paper.) Oh, yes, yes. I saw and thought of you.
    (baby Megamind's ship opens and he sees the prisoners crowding around looking at him.)
    Megamind: (voice-over.) Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.
    Prisoner: (to the other prisoners) Can we keep it?
    (one of the prisoners is showing him picture cards of a policeman and a burglar.)
    Megamind: (voice-over.) A place that taught me the differences between right and wrong. Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand had life handed to him on a silver platter.
    (baby Metro Man flies around the ceiling.)
    Lady Scott: Our baby can fly!
    Lord Scott: (without looking he continues to read his paper.) Yes, yes, nothin' but the best for you, darlin'.
    Megamind: (voice-over.) The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair! [the image freezes at Mr. GTS as the tip of his hair shines] But I had something far, far greater. My amazing intellect! A knack for building objects of mayhem.
    [Now riding a tricycle made out of Metro City license plates, baby Megamind rides down the hall with some of the inmates following him. His pacifier shoots a beam through the wall and is stopped by the warden.]
    (Megamind as a child is being escorted out of prison and taken to School)
    Megamind: (voice-over.) After a few years and with some time off for good behavior, I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning at a strange place called ‘shool’. It was there that I once again ran into Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes. He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft-headed groupies.
    (Metro Man as a child uses his laser vision to heat up popcorn and all the school children cheer and clap.)
    Megamind: (voice-over.) He bought their affections with showmanship, extravagant gifts of deliciousness. So I too would make this pop-ped corn and win over those mindless drones.
    Warden: Lights out! (The prison lights turn off. Megamind uses his pacifier as a flashlight to add some more sketches to his invention while Minion watches.)
    (Megamind's object to produce popcorn for the school children explodes and Metro Man uses his powers to put the fire out.)
    Megamind: (voice-over.) That's when I learned a very hard lesson. Good receives all the praise and adulation while evil is sent to quiet time in the corner. [Metro Man sends Megamind to the back of the room and is rewarded with a gold star sticker. A class photo] So fittin' in wasn’t really an option. (MM (Metro Man) plays a ukulele as the class sings "Itsy Bitsy Spider".) While they were learning Itzy Bitzy Spider, I learnt how to dehydrate inanimate objects and rehydrate them at will. (Megamind fires a ray at Minion turning him into a cube, and adds a drop of water on the cube to bring Minion back to life. The latter sees the former belly-up as he taps of the sphere. Minion wakes up as the two share a smile.) Some days it felt like it was just me and Minion against the world. No matter how hard I tried I was always the odd man out. (MM picks a girl with a cast and crutches to be on his team.) The last one picked. The screw up! The black sheep! (dodgeballs are being pelted at Megamind.) The Bad boy! (As a new round begins, Megamind buckles up a helmet with spikes on them. As the dodgeballs fire, lightning from the spikes reflect the balls hitting a car, a man's head, and nearly hitting the teacher, but deflected by MM. He is rewarded with yet another gold star sticker.)
    Megamind: [voice over] Was this my destiny? Wait... maybe it was! Being bad is the one thing I'm good at. Then it hit me; if I was the bad boy, then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all! I was destined to be a supervillain, and we were destined to be rivals! The die had been cast! And so began an enduring epic lifelong career…and I LOVED IT!
    (a gallery of newspaper articles appears, featuring Megamind and Metro Man's battles.)
    Megamind: (voice-over.) Our battles quickly got more elaborate. He would win some, I would almost win others! He took the name Metro Man, defender of Metro City (pronounced 'meh-traw-sitty,' from now on written as Metrocity). I decided to pick something a little more humble; Megamind, incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy!
    (in prison.)
    Warden: (Noticing the cell guard reading a newspaper.) Read on your own time! Open up! (The guard opens the window and Warden and sees that Megamind is not sitting in his chair. Concerned, he presses his face up closer to the window.) Hey!
    Megamind: BOO! (Warden jumps back. Megamind laughs.) Good morning Warden. Great news, I'm a changed man and I’m ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen.
    Warden: You're a villain! And you’ll always be a villain. You’ll never change and you’ll never leave.
    Megamind: You're fun.
    Warden: You got a present in the mail.
    Megamind: Is it a puppy?
    [the warden opens the box to reveal a hand watch]
    Warden: From Metro Man.
    [reading the card from Metro Man]
    Warden: 'To count every second of your eighty-five life sentences.' That's funny, never thought Metro Man was the gloatin' type. Oh, but he does have nice taste.
    [he puts the watch on his wrist]
    Warden: I think I’ll keep it.
    Megamind: Any chance you could give me the time. I don’t want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man museum.
    [the warden looks at the watch]

Warden: Oh, no! Looks like you’re gonna miss it, by several thousand years.

(the warden walks away.)

Megamind: Oh, am I? (starts to do an evil laugh.)

    Roxanne Ritchi: Happy Metro Man day, Metro City. It’s a beautiful day in beautiful downtown where we’re here to honor a beautiful man: Metro Man. His heart is an ocean that’s inside a bigger ocean. For years he’s been watching us with his super-vision, savin' us with his super-strength and carin' for us with his super-heart. Now it’s our turn to give something back. This is Roxanne Ritchi, reporting live from the dedication of the Metro Man museum.
    [she does the cut sign to her camera man]
    Hal: Wow! Okay, the stuff they make you read on air, that’s un-freakin'-believable! It’s crazy.
    Roxanne: I wrote that piece myself, Hal.
    Hal: What I was trying to say was, I can’t believe that in our modern society, they let, like actual art get onto the news.
    Roxanne: Nice save, Hal.
    Hal: What are we- like, let's just get a coffee or somethin'.
    Roxanne: Come on! It's time to get in the Metro Man Day Spirit!
    Hal: Well i-if I were Metro Man, Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time, that's the first thing.
    Roxanne: That's sweet, Hal.
    Hal: And I'd be watching you, like… a dingo watches a human baby.
    Roxanne: Mmm.
    Hal: Okay, that sounded…okay, that sounded a little weird.
    Roxanne: A little bit, yeah.
    [During Hal's next monologue, the invisible car drives up, the window rolls down, Minions arm comes out, holding a can. He sprays it in Roxanne's face, and she goes limp immediately. Minion then drives off through the crowd of people after placing Roxanne in the car.]
    Hal: And, you’re making a weird face, and that’s making me feel weird. Point is, I would watch you like something that watches something intently with love... not love, we're not in love, I'm not saying I love you. Hey, I love you, whatever. I'm-I'm not saying I'm in love with you, I'm saying... Roxanne? Roxaroo?
    [Cut to the Warden walking through the prison. The watch scans him, and projects the image of Megamind onto him. Several prisoners and prison guards (sitting down to play poker) look at him]
    Warden (with Megamind's voice): Get back to work! The city doesn't pay you to loaf.
    Guards: FREEZE!
    [They seize him and taze him]
    Warden (with Megamind's voice): Woah, what are you doin', guys? It's me! It's the warden.
    Guard (screen left): Hey! Open up!
    [In one fluid motion, the Warden is sat down as Megamind takes the watch, reverting the Warden back into his usual appearance]
    Warden: No, you fools. He's tricked us!
    Megamind: You were right.
    [Bad to the Bone begins playing as Megamind transforms into the form of the Warden]
    Megamind (with Warden's voice): I'll always be a villain. Muhuhahahaha!
    [(Bird's eye view) Megamind, disguised, dancingly strolls out into the open air, as guards pour into the facility around him. He salutes the guard at the end of the path, and waits as the invisible car pulls into view.]
    Minion: Well, hello good lookin'. Need a lift?
    Megamind (with Warden's voice): Certainly do you fantastic fish, you.
    Minion: Get in the car, you.
    Megamind (with Warden's voice): Woo! I'm free!
    [Megamind drops the disguise]
    Minion: Right?
    Megamind: Nice work sendin' be me the watch, Minion!
    Minion: You got it, Boss!
    Megamind: Punch it!
    [With a thunderous crunch, Metro Man punches and shatters a wall]
    Metro Man: Alright! Put your hands in the air.
    [The entirety of Metro City is gathered in front of him. They all scream as thousands of hands fly up. A remix of A Little Less Conversation by Elvis Presley plays. Metro Man flies into the air]
    Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man!
    Metro Man (cupping his hands to his ears): Who's your man?
    Audience: METRO MAN!
    Metro Man: Yeah, Metro City!
    [He flies just above the crowd with his hand extended, as dozens of high-fives clap against his arm]
    Metro Man: Gimme some! Come on, give it now! Give it to me. Right on! Give me the good stuff. All right!
    [Metro Man juggles some babies, throwing them back into their strollers, but not before kissing one on the cheek. The mayor throws him a microphone.]
    Metro Man: Hey, Metro City. Hey, hey.
    [the crowd starts cheering and screaming]
    Metro Man: You know, you know, I just wanna bring it down a bit. Boys, a little lower. Thank you, fellas.
    [the crowd stops cheering]
    Metro Man: Let’s get real for a moment. That’s right, that’s right. Ha-ha, that's right. Although getting a whole museum is super cool, is super cool. You wanna know what the greatest honor you’ve given me is? Do you really wanna know?
    [the crowd starts to cheer again]
    Metro Man: Really?
    [the crowd cheers louder]
    Metro Man: I’ll tell ya. The greatest honor you’ve given me is lettin' at me serve you. The helpless people of Metro City. At the end of every day, well, I often ask myself; who would I be without you?
    [a male voice from the crown shouts]
    Voice from Crowd: I love you, Metro Man!
    Metro Man: And I love you, random citizen.
    [Cut to the invisible car pulling into an evil lair]
    Megamind: Aahh, I tell you Minion, there’s no place like evil lair.
    Minion: I’ve kept it cold and damp just for you.
    Megamind: How…how do I look, Minion? Do I look bad?
    Minion: Disgustingly horrifying, sir.
    Megamind: You always know what to say.
    Minion: Oh, the Brainbots certainly missed you, sir.
    Megamind: Did you miss your daddy? Who's a menacin' little cyborg. You are! Yes, you are! Uh-uh, no biting. No, no, no, no, no, no. You want the wrench? Go get the wrench!
    [He throws a wrench and the Brainbots give chase]
    Minion: Aw, look at that.
    Megamind: Now, back to laughing.
    [They sharply inhale and hold their breath as Minion pulls a lever. Guard rails pop up, surrounding them. They start laughing, and at the top of their elevator ride, Roxanne begins to gain consciousness and thrash around.]
    Megamind: *Gasp* She's awake! Quick! To work!
    Roxanne (gagged): I know where I am. Megamind, I know who this is, I know it's you. Megamind! This bag stinks!
    [Megamind, gestures for a Brainbot to sit on his lap. Minion removes a cloth bag from the captive, Roxanne Ritchi]
    Megamind: Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Would it kill you to wash the bag?
    Megamind: You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi. I’m afraid no one can hear you.
    [Roxanne just looks at him coldly]
    Megamind: Wha-uh, why isn’t she screamin'?
    Minion: Miss Ritchi, if you don’t mind?
    Megamind: Like this…aaahhhh! But that’s…that’s a poor lady scream.
    [the brain bot he’s holding in hand suddenly bites his hand and he starts to scream in pain]
    Roxanne Ritchi: [sarcastically] He's a little better. Is there some kind of nerdy supervillain website where you get tesla coils and blinky dials?
    Minion: Actually, most of it comes from an outlet store in-
    Megamind: Don't answer that.
    Minion (whispering): Romania.
    Megamind: Don't! Stop! She's using her nosy reporter skills on your weak-willed mind to find out all our secrets.
    Minion: *Gasp!*
    Megamind: Such... tricks... won't work... on me...
    Roxanne: Please talk slower.
    Megamind: ...temptress!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Wait, what secrets? You are so predictable.
    Megamind: Predictable? Predictable? Oh, you call this… predictable?!
    [pulls a lever]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Your alligators, yes! Yeah, I was thinking about it on the way over.
    Megamind: What’s this? Boom! In your face.
    [brings down a gauntlet of blades]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Cliché.
    Megamind: No, look! Watch.
    [brings down the giant blades]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Juvenile.
    Megamind: Shock and awe!
    [Megamind brings up a chainsaw]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Tacky.
    Megamind: Oh, it’s so scary!
    [activates a cycle of spiked boots]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Seen it.
    Megamind: What’s this one do?
    [now frantic he unleashes a flamethrower]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Garish!
    [Megamind breaks down]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Okay, the spider’s new.
    Megamind: Spider?
    [sees the spider hanging in front of Roxanne]
    Megamind: Uh…yes! The…the speiiiider. Even the smallest bite from “arachnis deathicus” will instantly paralyze…
    [Roxanne blows the spider directly onto Megamind’s eye]
    Megamind: Oh!
    [Minion slams a mechanical arm into Megamind's face, dropping him to the floor instantly]
    Megamind: Get it off! Ow! It bit me!
    [Minion stomps on Megamind to try to kill the spider]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Give it up Megamind, your plans never work.
    [Megamind returns to his feet]
    Megamind: Let’s stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we?
    [A brainbot clamps onto his arm pointed skyward, causing him to let out the loudest scream yet, which blends into the Metro City crowd as the screen crossfades back to the ceremony.]
    Mayor: It is with great pleasure I present to Metro Man this new museum, if you please!
    [Lasers leap from Metro Man's eyes, vaporizing the ceremonial ribbon, and the curtain falls, revealing a titanic statue of Metro Man. A figure in a trench coat is shown in the crowd as a father appears irritated.]
    Father: Hey, uh. My kid can't see!
    [A Brainbot turns around, the coat drops, and the robot flies toward the stage. Black smoke appears from nowhere and blots out the sun as Megamind's enormous visage appears on the walls of the colossal building behind Metro Man. He performs an evil laugh as Metro Man flies up to eye level with Megamind's projection]
    Metro Man: Megamind.
    Megamind: Oh, bra-vo, Metro Man.
    [The crowd boos]
    Megamind: Booooooo! Yes, I can play along, too! Booooooo.
    Metro Man: Should have known you'd have tried to crash the party.
    Megamind: Oh, I intend to do more than crash it. This is the day you and Metrocity shall not soon forget!
    Metro Man: It’s pronounced ‘Metro City’!
    Megamind: Oh, potato, tomato, potato.
    Metro Man: We all know how this ends; with you behind bars!
    Megamind: Oh, I’m shakin' in my custom baby seal leather boots! You will leave Metrocity or this will be the last you ever hear of Roxanne Ritchi! Huh?
    [the screen next to him shows Roxanne tied to a chair]
    Metro Man: Roxanne! Don’t panic, Roxy. I’m on my way.
    Roxanne Ritchi: I’m not panicking.
    Megamind: [smirking] In order to stop me, you need to find me first, Metro Man!
    Roxanne Ritchi: We’re at the abandoned observatory!
    Megamind: Ah-huh! No, we’re not! Don’t listen to her! She’s crazy!
    [Metro Man flies toward an observatory on the horizon.]
    Minion: Metro Man approaching, sir.
    Roxanne: Ha!
    Megamind: Haha!
    Roxanne: Ha ha ha!
    Megamind: Muhuhuhahahahahaha!
    [He pulls a lever and all of the deadly devices surrounding Roxanne slowly retract into the walls. Roxanne sits, confused. Metro Man is shown above the observatory, and divebombs in. Roxanne braces for impact, but it never comes. Metro Man stands in the middle of the observatory, looking around, confused.]
    Metro Man: Hold on a second.
    [The observatory doors clamp shut]
    Megamind: Oh, good heavens! You didn't think you were in the REAL observatory, did you?
    [The music swells as the doors to the fake observatory open, revealing the actual building to be miles away]
    Megamind: Ready the death ray, Minion!
    Minion: Death ray, readyin'.
    [A satellite far above earth extends its solar panels and takes aim at the observatory. Cut to Metro Man, and Megamind's face appears on the inside of the observatory.]
    Megamind: Over here, old friend! In case you haven't noticed, you’ve fallen right into my trap.
    Metro Man: You can’t trap justice. It’s an idea, a belief!
    Megamind: But, even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time.
    Metro Man: Justice is a non-corrosive metal.
    Megamind: But metals can be melted by the heat of revange!
    Metro Man: It’s ‘revenge’, and it’s best served cold!
    Megamind: But it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil!
    Metro Man: Well, I think your warranty’s about to expire!
    Megamind: Maybe I got an extended warranty!
    Metro Man: Warranties are invalid if you don’t use the card for its intended purpose!
    Roxanne Ritchi: [exasperated] Uuhh! Girls, girls, you’re both pretty! Can I go home now!?
    Megamind: Of course, that is, if Metro Man can withstand the full concentrated power of the sun! FIRE!
    [Silence. Metro Man stares at Megamind, unamused. Megamind disappointedly walks over to Minion.]
    Megamind: Minion, fire?
    Minion: Uh, still warming up, sir.
    Megamind: Come again?
    Minion: Warming up, sir.
    Megamind: Warming up? The sun is warming up?
    Minion: One…second…more…and…just a tippy tappy, tippy tap, tap, tip, top more.
    Megamind: Honestly!
    Minion: And we are ready in just a few…hang on one second.
    Metro Man (through the monitor): On my way, Roxie.
    Megamind: [exasperated] Uuhh! I told you to have things ready. I told you countless times.
    Megamind: Why do you always blame me?
    [Metro Man collides with the walls of the observatory, and plummets the the floor, as Megaminds grabs his spider-bitten eye]
    Megamind: My spider bite is acting up!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Your plan is failing. Just admit it.
    [On the monitor, Metro Man continues to smash into the walls ineffectually.]
    Minion: Yeah, good luck with that one!
    Megamind: Who’s side are you on?
    Roxanne Ritchi: The losing side.
    Minion: Thank you.
    Roxanne Ritchi: [sarcastically] Uh, could someone stamp my frequent kidnapping card?
    [Megamind laughs]
    Megamind: You of all people know we discontinued that promotion. Ciao-ciao all!
    Roxanne: Same time next week?
    [Megamind walks away, and Minion shakes a can and prepares to spray it at Roxanne, but is interrupted when Metro Man collides loudly and collapses in the observatory]
    Metro Man (through the monitor): Fargin', dag, crab nuggets!
    Megamind (turning on his heels): What did he just say?
    Minion: Crab nuggets?
    Metro Man: Fackled fish cracker!
    Computer voice: Ten seconds to full power.
    Metro Man: Good lord, I’m trapped!
    [10]
    [Megamind looks at Metro Man through the projector]
    [9]
    Megamind: What kind of trickery is this?
    Metro Man: You mad genius. [8] Your dark gift [7] has finally paid off! [6]
    Megamind: It…it has?
    Metro Man: This dome [5] is obviously lined... with copper. [4]
    Megamind: Yeah, so? [3]
    Minion: Sir? Uh…
    [Minion points at computer screen]
    Metro Man: Copper drains my powers. [2]
    Megamind: Your weakness is copper? [1] You’re kiddin', right?
    Computer voice: Full power.
    [suddenly the satellite fires at the observatory. It explodes for the better part of a minute, and has no signs of life after]
    Minion: *cough* I don’t think even he could survive that.
    Megamind: Well, let’s not get our hopes up just yet.
    Minion: Look!
    Roxanne: (gasp) Metro Man!
    Megamind: (gasp) Metro Man! ...METRO MAN!!!
    [a white figure crashes into the observatory, knocking Megamind to the ground at Roxanne's feet. Perplexed as to how unhurt he is, Megamind lifts the slightly singed cape on his lap and finds a skeleton where he expected a Metro Man. He shouts incoherently and scrambles to his feet.]
    Roxanne: *gasp*
    Minion: Euww.
    [Beat.
    Minion: You... you did it, sir.
    Megamind: I did it.
    Mayor: He did it.
    Megamind: I did it!
    Warden: He did it.
    Minion: You did it, sir!
    Megamind: I did it!
    Minion: You did it!
    Megamind: I did it! Metrocity is MINE!
    [celebrating their victory in destroying Metro Man by walking down the street to City Hall]
    Minion: [singing] You did it, sir. You did it, sir. DId, did it.
    Megamind: [singing] Yes I did.
    Minion: Us!
    Megamind: I did it!
    Minion: We both did it.
    Megamind: Not us, I!
    Minion: You a little more than me, but still come on! When they’re givin' out the awards I’m going to be right here next to you, right sir?
    Megamind: What awards? Awards for what?
    [beat]
    Megamind: Hit it!
    [Highway to Hell begins playing as smoke fills the city block. Police take aim, and hesitantly lower their weapons. Megamind walks up to City Hall unbothered, and in his attempts to shut the music off, Minion briefly switches between ACDC and Minnie Ripperton. He hits the boombox, and it falls silent.]
    Megamind (into microphone): First off, what a turnout! How wild is this?! All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe. Are there any questions? Come on? Yes, you at the back.
    Roxanne: I’m sure that we’d all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city.
    Megamind: Good, I’m glad you asked that. Imagine the most horrible, terrifying, evil thing you can possibly think of and multiply it…by six! [the crowd nervously mumurs] In the meantime, I want you to carry on with the dreary normal things you, normal people do. Let’s just have fun with this, come on! And I will get back to you.
    [he walks backwards into the white house with Minion following close behind]
    Megamind: [whispering] Now slam the door really hard.
    [Minion slams the door hard but his shadow can been seen through the door]
    Megamind: They, they can still see you.
    Minion: Now?
    Megamind: Your elbow's still in.
    Minion: Oh. *Laughs.*
    Megamind: Good. *Laughs.*
    Minion (singing, carrying Megamind): There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.
    Megamind: Oh, Minion, did you think this day would ever come?
    Minion: No way. Not at all, sir. Never. Never in a million…
    [Megamind gives him an evil look]
    Minion: I mean, yes, I did.
    Megamind: Look at the intricate mouldings!
    Minion: I'm looking! I'm lookin'!
    [noticing the large windows inside the White House]
    Megamind: And what’s this? It’s like one of the giant monitors in the lair, but it seems to carry only one station.
    Minion: Oh, that sir, is called a window.
    Megamind: Window!
    Minion: All the kids are looking through them.
    Megamind: Oooh! I’ve never had a view before. Metrocity, Minion. It’s all mine. If my parents could see me now.
    Minion: Sir, I'm sure they’re smilin' down from evil heaven.
    [they then proceed to go on a crime spree accompanied by Crazy Train... which doesn't last long]
    [Megamind is shown in the mayor's(?) office, talking to a Drinking Bird toy]
    Megamind: I know, I know. Always thirsty, never satisfied. I understand you, little well dressed bird. Purposeless, emptiness. It’s a vacuum, isn’t it? It’s…What’s your vacuum like?
    [Minion breaks through the door, singing and playing air guitar on a statue]
    Minion: [singing] Goin' off the rails on a crazy train, sir!
    Megamind: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Not now, Minion. I’m in a heated, existential discussion with this dead-eyed, plastic desk toy.
    Minion: Is…is something wrong, sir?
    Megamind: Just think about it. We have it all. Yet we have nothing. It’s just too easy now.
    Minion: I’m sorry, you’ve lost me, sir.
    Megamind: [wearily] I mean, we did it. Right?
    Minion: Uh, well, you did it, sir. Yes, you’ve made that perfectly clear.
    Megamind: Then why do I feel so…meh-lahn-choly?
    Minion: Meh-lahn-choly?
    Megamind: Unhappy.
    Minion: Oh, well, uh…what if tomorrow we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi? That always seems to lift your spirits.
    Megamind: Good idea, Minion. But without him, what’s the point?
    [through his window he notices the statue of Metro Man]
    Minion: Him, sir?
    Megamind: Nothin'.
    Minion: OK, um, alright, well just, uh, suh- somethin' to consider, and um, well, I just think I'll power down for a while then.
    [Crossfade to same place, sunset]
    Roxanne Ritchi: He was always there for us. Dependable. Perhaps we took him for granted, or maybe... we never really know how good we have it until it's gone. We miss you, Metro Man... I... miss you... and I just have one question for Megamind... are you happy now??? This is Roxanne Ritchi, reporting from a city without a hero. Coming up next, are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know.
    [she does the cut sign to Hal]
    Hal: Aaand, wrap that up and give it to a child on Christmas! 'Cause we’re done.
    Roxanne: OK. See you tomorrow, Hal.
    Hal: Wait, Roxy. I’m havin’ a party at my house, gonna be off the hook, or whatever. You should come over. I got a DJ, rented a bouncy house, made a gallon of dip. It’s gonna be sick!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Oh, I…I don’t know, Hal. I don’t really feel like being around a bunch of people.
    Hal: No, no, no! That’s the best part, it’ll just be like, you and me.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Wow! That…um, that’s certainly very tempting. But…
    Hal: I did hire a wedding photographer. That’s just in case we were like, something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it like, maybe we should have this for like, ever. Like a memory, you know?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Um, I’m gonna pass. I have some work here that I need to do, anyway.
    Hal: Cool. So, Thursday? Soft Thursday?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Goodnight, Hal.
    Hal: That’s a soft yes on Thursday.
    [Roxanne turns and goes up the stairs, he goes back to his van]
    Hal: [to himself] What’s wrong with me?! Rented a bouncy house! chicks don’t like bouncy houses, they like clowns!
    [he hits his van and Roxanne hears him shout]
    Hal: Ow! Aaah! Stupid van! You broke my finger!
    [talking to Metro Man’s statue]
    Megamind: I made a horrible mistake. I didn't mean to destroy you. I mean, I meant to destroy you, but I didn't think it would really work.
    Roxanne: What are we supposed to do? Without you, evil is running rampant through the streets.
    Megamind: I’m so tired of running rampant through the streets. What’s the point of being bad when there’s no good to try and stop you?
    Roxanne: Someone has to stop Megamind.
    Bernard: Hey, we're closing soon.
    Roxanne: Oh, you scared me. Barry, right?
    Bernard: Bernard.
    Roxanne: Bernard, I was just... well, I was... talkin' to myself. You probably think I'm a little bit nuts.
    Bernard: I'm not allowed to insult guests directly.
    Roxanne: Thank you, uh, just, Bernard, I'll just be another minute.
    Bernard: Uhhhhhh...
    Roxanne: Thanks.
    Megamind: I had so many evil plans on works; The Illiteracy Beam, Typhoon Cheese, Robo Sheep. Battles now we will never have. You know, I never had the chance to say goodbye. So it’s good that have this time now. You know, before I destroy the place. Nothing personal, it just brings back too many painful memories.
    Roxanne: Hello? Hello?
    Megamind (whispered): Roxanne!
    [after Megamind has set the bomb to go off Roxanne hears Megamind on the other side of the Metro Man statue and she runs to investigate. Megamind, not wanting to be caught in his jammies, runs away and bumps into Bernard]
    Bernard: That’s a pretty tasteless costume.
    Megamind: Costume?!
    Bernard: Megamind’s head is not that grossly exaggerated.
    [Megamind scans Bernard with his watch and pulls out the Dehydration Gun]
    Bernard: Uuh! You even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How…
    [Megamind shoots his dehydration gun at Bernard and catches the cube ]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Hello, who’s there?
    [Megamind just makes it in time in transforming himself to look like Bernard]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Oh! Whew! It’s just you, Bernard.
    Megamind: Oh, yes. It’s just me. Bernard!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Well, thank you for letting me stay.
    Megamind: Look, I wouldn’t stay here for more than two minutes and thirty-seven seconds if I were you. We’re havin' the walls and ceilings removed.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Wow! That sounds like quite the renovation. I guess I’ll um…catch a ride down with you then.
    [gets into the elevator with Megamind disguised as Bernard]
    Roxanne Ritchi: I kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last-minute escapes.
    Megamind: Yeah, he was really good at those.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Oh! If only the world had a reset button.
    Megamind: I’ve looked into the reset button.
    [he breaks down]
    Megamind: The science is impossible.
    Roxanne: Oh Bernard, I didn't know you had... feelings.
    Megamind: Metro Man’s gone and now there’s no one left to challenge Megamind.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Oh, come on, Bernard! As long as there’s evil, good will rise up against it.
    Megamind: Uuh, I wish!
    Roxanne Ritchi: I believe someone’s gonna stand up to Megamind.
    Megamind: You really think so?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Yeah, it’s like they say. Heroes aren’t born, they’re made!
    Megamind: Heroes can be made. That’s it! All you need are the right ingredients.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Yeah. Bravery.
    Megamind: Yes.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Strength.
    Megamind: Of course!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Determination.
    Megamind: Imperative! And a smidgen of DNA. Oh, with that anyone can be a hero!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Yeah!
    [he laughs and picks up Roxanne in excitement, his alarm goes off]
    Megamind: I think we should run!
    [standing in front of the Metro Man museum]
    Megamind: Bye!
    [Roxanne drives away in a cab]
    Megamind: Time to put the past behind us.
    [he transforms himself back to being Megamind]
    Megamind: Only the future…
    [the Metro Man museum suddenly explodes in his face]
    Megamind: Aaaah! Oh! I’m too close! I’m genuinely scared right now! Oh! I hope no one's seein' this! Aah!
    Minion: Create a hero? Wait, wait…what?! Why would you do that?
    Megamind: So I have someone to fight. Minion, I’m a villain without a hero. A yin with no yang. A bullfighter with no bull to fight. In other words, I have no purpose. Now, ask me how I'm going to do it! Go on! Ask!
    Minion: *Sigh* How are you gonna do it?
    [Megamind shows him the poster boards he’s made with all his ideas]
    Megamind: I’m going to give someone, I don’t know who yet, Metro Man’s powers. We’re going to train that someone to become Metrocity’s new hero. Over here, follow!
    [revealing the last poster board]
    Megamind: And then finally, I’m going to fight that hero in an epic battle of good and evil. Which will put everything back the way it was when the world was perfect and rosy.
    Megamind: Behold, Minion, Metro Man’s cape! Look closely.
    [he pushes a large lense towards Minion]
    Megamind: Tell me what you see?
    Minion: Dandruff?
    Megamind: Ha…ha…yes! It’s his DNA! From this, we’ll extract the source of Metro Man’s awesome power.
    Minion: Sir, I think this is a bad idea.
    [extracting Metro Man’s essence]
    Megamind: Yes, this is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of bad!
    Minion: But I’m sayin' this is a kind of bad that, okay, you might think is good from your “bad” perception, but from a “good” perception, it…it…it’s just plain bad!
    Megamind: Oh, you don’t know what’s good for bad! Now, we have just one shot at this. We must find a suitable subject. Someone of noble heart and mind. Who puts the welfare of others above their own.
    [a tune from a cell phone goes off]
    Megamind: What on earth is that?
    Minion: It seems to be emanating from there, sir.
    [points to Megamind’s ass, Megamind pulls out the cell phone from his back pocket and answers it]
    Megamind: Ollo?
    Minion: Um, it’s ‘hello’.
    [speaking into the cell phone]
    Megamind: Oh. Hello?
    [to Minion]
    Megamind: Like that?
    [Roxanne’s voice comes through the cell phone]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Bernard, it’s Roxanne.
    [whispering to Minion]
    Megamind: It’s Roxanne!
    Roxanne: I just wanna thank you for inspiring me the other day.
    Megamind: Oh! You inspired me too.
    Roxanne: Great. It’s time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can’t push us around.
    Megamind: Oh! Oh, really?
    [whispers to Minion]
    Megamind: She’s so cute!
    Roxanne: I’m already hot on his trail.
    Megamind: Uh-huh. And what gives you that idea?
    Minion: Uh, sir?
    Megamind: I just found his secret hideout!
    [Roxanne’s face appears on the security TV screens]
    Megamind: [shouting] How did she find my hideout?
    [back onto the cell phone]
    Megamind: Uh, how did you find his hideout?
    Roxanne Ritchi: This is the only building in Metro City with a fake observatory on the roof.
    [xylophone sting with close up on Megamind's horrified face.]
    Megamind: Okay. There’s no way she’ll find the secret entrance.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Haaa! There’s a doormat here that says ‘Secret Entrance’.
    Megamind: Minion!
    Minion: I kept forgetting where it was!
    Megamind: She’ll discover all our secrets! You dimwitted creation of science!
    Roxanne: What?
    Megamind: What? Oh, not you, Roxanne, I was just yelling at my... mother's urn. Don't do anything I'll be right there.
    Hal: Roxanne? Oh no, not again!
    [after Roxanne has entered into Megamind secret hideout]
    Megamind: Roxanne?
    [Roxanne turns around in surprise and see’s Bernard who’s in fact Megamind in disguise]
    Megamind: Woah!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Oh, I’m glad you here. Wait, how did you get here so fast?
    Megamind: Well, I uh, I happen to be speed walking nearby when you called.
    Roxanne Ritchi: In a suit?
    Megamind: Uh-huh. It’s called, formal speed walking. But that’s not important. I’d better take the lead. This way looks exciting.
    Roxanne Ritchi: No, it says exit.
    Megamind: Uh, which is the abbreviation for ex-citing, right?
    Roxanne: This is the motherlode!
    Megamind: Ah!
    Roxanne: Wow! Just look at this thing.
    Megamind: Wow!
    Roxanne: Y'know, I really could use your help in deciphering all this.
    Megamind: Really?
    Roxanne: You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?
    Megamind: Yes, right.
    Roxanne: Together we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it. Are you in?
    Megamind: Oh, what fun!
    Roxanne: That's what I want to hear!
    Megamind: Minion. Code: Send In The Brainbots.
    Minion: You know, the whole point of a code is-
    Megamind: Oh, Code: Just Do It, Minion!
    [Brainbots carry Megamind away, separating him and Roxanne]
    Megamind: It's me, you fools!
    Roxanne (noticing the gun): Bernard!
    Megamind (dropping his disguise): It's Daddy!
    [The Brainbots drop him and he stands up, just as Roxanne makes eye contact]
    Roxanne: What have you done with Bernard?
    Megamind: Oh, Bernard? Oh, yes. I’m doing horrible things to that man. I don’t want to get into it, but lasers, spikes.
    [he opens a trap door and put his head in pretending to be Bernard shouting]
    Megamind: Oh, please, don’t! Not the lasers and the spikes!
    [speaking to Roxanne]
    Megamind: You know, the drill.
    [puts his back in the trap door pretending to shout as Bernard]
    Megamind: Oh, no! Not the drill? Aaargh!
    Roxanne: Let him go! Or...
    Megamind: Or what?
    Roxanne: Or I’m gonna find out what this weird looking gun does!
    [she points the gun that has Metro Man’s DNA extraction at Megamind]
    Megamind: No, don't shoot! Don’t shoot that gun! I’ll just go get him.
    [Roxanne looks as the trap door opens and it’s Megamind transformed as Bernard]
    Megamind: Unhand me you fiend! Never! His-his strength’s too much!
    [transformed back as Megamind he pops his out of the trap door]
    Megamind: Aargh! I work out!
    [the trap door opens and it Megamind transformed as Bernard]
    Megamind: Well, it’s really paying off! You’re so fit and strangely charismatic!
    [the door closes and suddenly Megamind transformed as Bernard is thrown out]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Are you okay?
    Megamind: I did my best, but he’s too fantastic! Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.
    Roxanne: I got us covered.
    [Megamind drops his disguise behind Roxanne]
    Megamind: Let go, it's mine!
    Roxanne: Bernard, run!
    [They struggle and a monitor briefly enters the frame]
    Hal (through the monitor): Roxanne?
    Megamind: You're going to break it!
    Roxanne: Give it to me!
    [The gun fires, bouncing around, entering a vent]
    Megamind: Oh, no!
    [The shot bounces around in some pipes and strikes Hal]
    Hal: Ow!
    Minion: Who on Earth is that?
    [Megamind pulls Roxanne put out from door marked exit which is a room filled with music, disco lighting and alligators]
    Roxanne: Oh, Bernard! You were right about that door bein' exciting.
    [Brainbots find Roxanne and Megamind, and give chase]
    Megamind: This way!
    Roxanne (grabbing dynamite and lighting it): Ha!
    Megamind: What are you doin'?
    Roxanne (throwing it to Megamind): This'll stop them. Here!
    Megamind: Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?
    Roxanne: Just throw it!
    Megamind (whispering): Daddy's sorry!
    [The resulting explosion launches the two out of the lair and onto the ground outside, meeting Hal]
    Roxanne: Wow! That was really exciting!
    Megamind: Yeah.
    Roxanne: You were very strong in there.
    Megamind: I know.
    Roxanne: I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.
    Hal: What’s goin' on?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Hal, what happened?
    [Hal is holding is nose as the Metro Man’s DNA extraction was accidentally shot up his nose]
    Hal: I think a bee flew up my nose. I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you, but like, fifty ninjas tried to attack me. So, I uh, had to beat them all up and I, I did and they were all like, cryin' and stuff…
    Megamind: Wow! A brave one, isn’t he?
    Hal: Who are you?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Oh, thi…this is Bernard. He’s my partner.
    Hal: Partner?
    Megamind: Yes, yes. Partner.
    Hal: Well, look partner, I’m her partner. She doesn’t know what she’s saying, she’s been through a traumatic experience.
    Roxanne Ritchi: I better take him home. Thanks again, Bernard.
    [she hugs him]
    Roxanne Ritchi: I’ll call you tomorrow, partner.
    Megamind: Yeah, okay. I’d like that.
    Hal: That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me.
    Minion (through Megamind's watch): Sir? Sir! Code: Did You Find Out Who It Was?
    Megamind: Uh? Oh... oh.
    [Megamind reaches for his watch and drops his disguise as the van drives away]
    Megamind: Code: Get the Car.
    Minion: Code: Right Away Sir.
    [Cut to a sweeping shot going from an overpass, panning down to an apartment building and zooming into the TV van, as the door opens, and Hal exits]
    Hal: Uh, bye!
    Roxanne: See you tomorrow, Hal.
    Hal: I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.
    Megamind: Who is this man we've infused with god-like power?
    [Hal, holding his nose, crosses the road; he trips and cries out as he slides over the hood of Megamind’s invisible car]
    Minion [as Hal moans in the background]: Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart. He's twenty eight years old, no criminal record, actually no records at all. Apparently this man hasn’t accomplished anything.
    Hal [faintly]: What... just happened?
    Megamind: Not yet, Minion. Not yet!
    Hal: Could this day get any more funtastic?
    Minion: So, I will just go ahead and defuse him, since this is clearly a mistake.
    Megamind: NO, MINION! There's something much more powerful at work here. This is no mistake. It's destiny.
    [Cut to Hal's apartment as Megamind explodes the door, causing Hal to be trapped between his bed and the wall, and Megamind and Minion walk in]
    Megamind: Hal Shtewart! Prepare for your destiny!
    [Minion carries in a new door and promptly installs it where the old one used to exist]
    Megamind: Hal? Hal Shturt? Am I saying it right?
    [Muffled screams emanate from the bed]
    Minion: Stewart.
    Megamind: Ah.
    [Minion pulls down Hal's bed, freeing him]
    Hal: Ah! Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.
    Megamind: Oh, look, it’s Hal Stewart. Quick, the spray!
    [Minion tries to spray something from a can, but the can squeaks emptily]
    Hal: ah!
    Minion: Oops! All out!
    Megamind: Well, use the forget-me stick.
    Minion: Oh, right!
    [a satisfying WHACK rings out from the bat as Hal's limp body falls onto the bed]
    Megamind: Ah! Just look at him.
    Minion: No, he doesn’t look quite the hero type to me.
    Megamind: Oh, you’re such a pill, Minion.
    [Minion releases Hal's bed, and it folds up into the wall, taking an unconscious Hal along for the ride]
    Megamind: A potter couldn't ask for finer clay.
    [Megamind inhales deeply]
    Megamind: I smell a hero.
    Minion: I smell... something burning.
    Megamind: I think it’s working. Places! Places! Pla…places! Places! Places.
    [They hurry over to the pull-down bed]
    Megamind: Do you have your disguise?
    [Minion puts on a "kiss the cook" apron and a wig while Megamind activates his watch]
    Minion: What?
    [Megamind disguised as Jor-El looks at Minion]
    Megamind: Oh, you look fantastic.
    [The music swells as two Adonic arms burst from the bed, which crashes to the ground, revealing Hal, who is now incredibly tall and muscular]
    Megamind: [Lipsed] Rise, my glorious creation. Rise, and come to Papa!
    Hal: What’s goin' on?
    Megamind: Easy, my child.
    Hal: Who are you?
    Megamind: I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice, honor, and nobility. I am your father.
    Hal: So you’re like, my space dad?
    Megamind: Yeah, I’m like your space dad.
    Hal: And you are what?
    Minion: I’m your space stepmom. I’ve had some work done recently.
    Hal: Is this some kind of dream?
    Megamind: This is a dream come true. You’ve been blessed with unfathomable power.
    Hal: What kind of power?
    Megamind: Unfathomable. It’s unf…with…without fathom.
    Hal: Woah!
    Megamind: Yeah, we’ve come to guide you on your path to be Metrocity’s new hero and battle the super genius of Megamind!
    [Megamind tears a magazine and holds it up to a mirror, showing a Tighten-headed Metro Man with Roxanne in his arms]
    Megamind: I know this is a lot to take in. It may take months for you to come to grips with—
    [Hal levitates]
    Hal: No freakin' way!
    [Hal suddenly shoots through the back wall of his apartment, plummeting into traffic. Multiple crashes are heard]
    Megamind [running to the Hal-shaped hole in the wall]: I wasn't finished!
    Hal [wearing a car]: Woo hoo! I'm gonna be a hero! I'm gonna be a hero! Woo hoo!
    Megamind: See, Minion? He's perfect!
    [ELO's Mr. Blue Sky begins playing as Tighten and company begin a training sequence]
    Megamind: And, action!
    Minion: Someone help me!
    [Hal falls from the ceiling]
    Hal: I'm OK!
    [Hal ignores Minion and completely dismembers and then melts the stand-in Megamind]
    Hal: You... should not... be bad! Zap! Zap! Zap! Haha! Hahahahaha!
    [As Hal is melting the mannequin, Megamind is horrified by it]
    Megamind: [Normal] The flames of my evil burn bright! [Lipsed] Now you say something cool back at me.
    Hal (flying and giving himself a wedgie): Look, doesn't even hurt! Don't even feel it!
    [Cut to Megamind teaching Hal how to fly through Metro City]
    Megamind: No, no, no, no, no, no! Stomach down, hands up! Like Metro Man! Watch out!
    Hal: Wait!
    [They crash into a billboard]
    Megamind: He’s hopeless. Hopeless!
    Minion: Maybe we should change tactics.
    Megamind: You think so?
    Minion: Oh, you know how boys are.
    [Megamind gets a text message from Roxanne asking him to meet her]
    Minion: They love video games. I could throw a few parts together…
    [Megamind types back a reply text]
    Megamind: Can’t wait. LOL. Smiley face.
    Minion: Can’t wait for what, sir?
    [Megamind disguised as Bernard is having dinner with Roxanne]
    Megamind: [laughing] Aha! That was such a funny story! Huh! And brilliantly told by the way. Okay, now you tell one.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.
    Megamind: And I never heard you laugh before.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Yeah, it’s been a while. Feels pretty good.
    [Cut to a mock-up of Donkey Kong]
    Megamind (distracted): And, action!
    [Hal is making his way through the course, destroying miniguns, cars and jumping over fire barrels, which are thrown by Minion. The scene next cuts to Roxanne and "Bernard" riding bikes]
    Roxanne: You don't get out much, do you?
    Megamind: Oh, what fun!
    Roxanne: I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid. It was one of my favorite things to do. Now look at it. It's a dump.
    [Cut to Megamind and Minion in the Spiderbot as they dehydrate trash around the city, including a cat]
    Minion: Why are we cleanin' up the city, sir?
    Megamind: Well we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump now, do we?
    [Roxanne and Megamind (As Bernard) in the museum, paintings returned]
    Roxanne: They're all back! But how, why?
    Megamind: Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.
    [As Megamind and Roxanne go around the museum, Brainbots put on the paintings back, which Mona Lisa one has a blue moustache on it]
    [Hal and Megamind flying through the city]
    Megamind: That's it! Be free, my beautiful dove!
    [Roxanne and Megamind disguised as Bernard are having a picnic]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Okay, okay. Metro Man and I were never a couple.
    Megamind: [Stunned] But I thought you two…
    Roxanne Ritchi: I know, everybody did, it’s just he was never really my type.
    Megamind: Really?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Okay, now you tell me something. Something you’ve never told anyone.
    Megamind: Well, in shh…school, none of the other kids really liked me. I was always the last one picked for everything.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Mmm, it’s too bad that we didn’t go to the same school.
    [Megamind disguised as Jor-El gives Hal a present box]
    Megamind: Hal, I think you’re ready for this.
    [Hal opens and takes out a really small super-hero costume]
    Hal: Do I have a son?
    Megamind: No. Ha…ha! You make me laugh. It stretches, it’s for you.
    Hal: Hey, what’s the T stand for?
    Megamind: Titan.
    Hal: Tighten? What’s that supposed to mean?
    Megamind: It was the only name I could trademark.
    Hal: Oh.
    Megamind: Do you have someone special in your life, Hal?
    Hal: No, not yet, but there's this really, really good-lookin' one I've got my eye on currently.
    [Following Hal's vision, it shows that he is looking at Roxanne, who is putting up Megamind's paper plans]
    Megamind: That's very good. Romance is very inspiring.
    Hal: That's what I hear.
    Megamind: All you have to do is save her, and she'll be yours.
    Minion: Who wants churros?
    Megamind: I do!
    Hal: I-I do!
    Megamind: Yeah! Churros all the way around!
    Hal: Thanks, Space Step Mom!
    Megamind: On the count of three, unsheath your churro. One, two, three.
    All three: To Titan!
    Megamind: Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind, and the city will know your name!
    [Megamind is watching Roxanne on his many TV screens reporting news while Minion is preparing his cape]
    Roxanne Ritchi: The city’s parks restored to their original glory. The streets the safest they’ve been. The banks reopened. Has something happened to Megamind? Has someone tamed this monster? This is Roxanne Ritchi, cautiously optimistic and pleasantly confused.
    Minion: Well you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir.
    Megamind: Huh? Oh, yes. How long is this going to take, Minion?
    Minion: Just a few alterations, sir, and I will be done with your most terrifying cape yet! I’m calling it... [Whispering] The Black Mambaaaaa…!
    Megamind: Black Mamba. Perfect! Ooh, gosh, I am running late, I have got to go.
    Minion: What? Where…where are you going, sir? We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning. We haven’t even tested your big battle suite yet!
    Megamind: You attend to the details, Minion. I have to…run a quick errand.
    Minion: You don’t run errands. What’s going on here?
    Megamind: What?
    Minion: Oh, wait a minute!
    [Minion smells Megamind]
    Minion: Are you wearing Jean Paul Gaultier’s Pour Homme?
    Megamind: It’s just my natural musk. Now, where are the car keys? Ah!
    [Just as Megamind was about to take the car keys, Minion takes them away, deep in thought]
    Minion: Ah, ah, ah, ah. This is about Miss Ritchi, isn’t it? You’re going on a date with her!
    [Megamind laughs]
    Megamind: No, my main man! Get outta town!
    Minion: Oh, this is bad. This is bad! You’ve fallen in love with her!
    Megamind: You are forgetting your place, Minion! Now give me the keys!
    [Minion stretches the arm in which his hand is holding the car key, much to Megamind's frustration]
    Minion: What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?
    Megamind: She will never find out. That’s the point of lying!
    [Megamind pushes a button on Minion robotic body, which makes his stretched arm to fall]
    Megamind: Honestly, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think this was your first day of being evil.
    Minion: No! (He turns the car invisible, and Megamind trips on it) This has gone far enough!
    [Minion drops the car keys inside his helmet]
    Megamind: Oh, that was really grown up!
    [Megamind chases Minion]
    Minion: Sir, sir, please, this is for your own good!
    Megamind: Oh, what do you know?
    [As the chase goes on, Brainbots watch from atop]
    Minion: I may not know much, but I do know this; the bad guy doesn’t get the girl!
    Megamind: Maybe I don’t want to be the bad guy anymore!
    [Minion screams]
    Megamind: You heard me!
    [in shock Minion whispers]
    Minion: Who are you?
    Megamind: Now give me the keys!
    Minion: No! [Minion turns the car visible again, and Megamind trips on it]
    Minion: My sole purpose in life is to look after you!
    Megamind: Well, I don’t need you to look after me.
    Minion: What are you s…what are you sayin'? You don’t need me?
    Megamind: Let me make it clear. Code: I Don’t Need You.
    Minion: You know what? You know what? [Upset, Minion throws Megamind the car keys and leaves] Code: I’ll Just Pack My Thing And Go!
    Megamind: Code: Fine!
    Minion: Code: Fine Back!
    [Just as Minion’s about to leave]
    Minion: Well, good luck on your date!
    Megamind: I will!
    Minion: That doesn’t even make any sense!
    Megamind: I know!
    [Minion leaves and Megamind stares into a mirror broken during the fight. He slowly activates his watch, and "Bernard" smiles sadly at himself. He rattles his keys and walks over to the car as the camera pans right, to black, then to Roxanne's apartment; she's about to leave for her date, but is intently inspecting all of the clues she's collected so far]
    Roxanne: I know I am so close, I can feel it! *Sigh* Ok, ok. I just have to take a step back.
    [She stares at her reflection in her glass door, and recognizes... something]
    Roxanne: Wait a minute.
    [She opens the door to her balcony and backs outside, facing the mega-mess of paper inside her apartment. Slowly, the papers start turning, aligning in a way that resembles a human form, surrounded by the letters "TitaN"]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Titan! What’s a Titan?
    [Hal dressed in his Titan superhero costume floats up behind her]
    Hal: My super ears are burning!
    [Roxanne screams in shock]
    Hal: I usually just scare criminals. You haven’t been naughty, have you?
    [Roxanne just looks at him in shock]
    Hal: I’m totally messin’ with you. I’m totally messin' with you. The name’s Tighten.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Titan!
    Hal: You very own heroic guardian of pure awesome. What’s your name? Just kiddin', I know everything about you. Oh, oh! (he dives down, retrieves a flower cart, and flies up to Roxanne.) And I-and I brought some flowers. I didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed, you know, all of them.
    [Roxanne stares, confused and a little creeped out]
    Hal: Ok, you don't like flowers? Ok, uh... forget the flowers. (he throws the cart away, causing it to crash)
    Roxanne: What do you want?
    Hal: I thought we maybe could go for a little flight around town. Get to know each other first.
    [He grabs Roxanne and starts flying over the city at fast pace, and she begins screaming and protesting]
    Hal: This must be very thrillin' for you.
    Roxanne Ritchi: What-what do you think you’re doin'?
    Hal: Oh, am I going to fast? You’re probably right, I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic. [he drops her on purpose] Woops! [he flies down and catches her to rescue her] Saved ya. You are lucky to have such a great hero here!
    Roxanne: Don't you ever! (she pushes him and she plummets, screaming)
    Hal: Oh, no! Somebody do something! [Realizes] Oh, right, right, duh! I gotcha! (He flies down to her) I gotcha!
    [She falls, and is now mere feet above the pavement as a red blur swoops through and catches her. He fumbles for a while, almost dropping her or crashing into a car or five, but eventually holds her with a temporarily safe trajectory]
    Hal: That was a close one! You almost died, but I saved you!
    Roxanne: aaaaaAAAAAH BUILDING!
    Hal: Ah!
    [He flings her by her leg up at the last moment, barely missing the building, and Roxanne begins falling again, screaming along the way. Tighten bursts out of the building with moments to spare, cushioning her fall with a chair]
    Hal: Gotcha! Woo! I'm sorry, what were you sayin'? I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life!
    Roxanne: Put me down, right now!
    Hal: Ok, alright, alright, hold on.
    [He flies over to the peak of Metro Tower, and finally puts her down]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Are you crazy?
    Hal: I suppose I’m a little crazy…about you!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Who are you? Really?
    Hal: Oh, oh, right! Well, prepare to have your mind blown, little lady. [he takes off his face mask] Ta-da.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Hal?
    Hal: Yeah! Isn’t this great? Now there’s nothing keeping us apart.
    Roxanne Ritchi: No, it’s not great.
    Hal: Wow, our first fight. This is so us, we’re like an old married couple.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Look, there is no ‘us’! Okay? There will never be an ‘us’..
    Hal: But... I have powers! I have a cape, I'm the good guy.
    Roxanne: You are a good guy, Hal, but you don't understand.
    Hal (quietly): no... No...
    Roxanne: We need to find out why-
    Hal: This, THIS-
    Roxanne: Hal-
    Hal: This isn't right!
    Roxanne: Just take a deep breath and listen to me for a moment
    Hal (during Roxanne's line): You're supposed to be with me!
    Roxanne: I'm tryin' to warn you, Hal.
    Hal: It's TIGHTEN! IT'S TIGHTEN, NOT HAL!!! [furiously files away, leaving Roxanne trapped on the Metro Tower.]
    [Megamind disguised as Bernard is waiting at the restaurant for Roxanne, and lights up the candle with his weapon quickly, when she arrives late with windswept hair]
    Roxanne: Bernard!
    Megamind: Roxanne!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Sorry I’m late.
    Megamind: Wow, your hair! It looks exciting!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Mmm, not the only exciting development of the night. Megamind’s created a new hero and I know why.
    [POP! A champagne pops open)
    Roxanne Ritchi: It all makes sense now. He missed getting his butt kicked…
    Megamind: Uh-huh.
    Roxanne Ritchi: …so he created a new hero…
    Megamind: Yeah?
    Roxanne Ritchi: …to kick it for him!
    [Megamind is about to drink when he spits it out in surprise]
    Megamind: Wow? Wow!
    Roxanne Ritchi: But why pick Hal? Hal is the worst possible person you could pick!
    Megamind: Wow! That’s a lot to take in.
    Roxanne Ritchi: It…it…it boggles my mind!
    Megamind: I am extremely boggled. You know, I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of who’s kickin' whose butt. But in the meantime, let’s enjoy each other’s company.
    Roxanne Ritchi: I’m sorry, Bernard. Of course, you’re right. You know, I could use a breather.
    [she raises her champagne glass for a toast]
    Roxanne Ritchi: To, Bernard. For being the only normal thing in my crazy, upside-down world.
    Megamind: To, being normal.
    [The music softly swells, the camera moves back to outside the restaurant window, and they clink glasses, as a saddened Tighten longingly looks inside, and defeatedly flies away. Close back in on the two.]
    Megamind: Roxanne?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Yes.
    Megamind: Say I wasn’t so normal. Say I was bald and I had the complexion of…of a popular primary color as a random, non-specific example. Would you still enjoy my company?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Of course! You don’t judge a book by its cover or a person from the outside.
    Megamind: Oh! That’s a relief to hear.
    Roxanne Ritchi: You judge them based on their actions.
    Megamind: Well, that seems kind of petty. Don’t you think?
    [Roxanne laughs then kisses Megamind, meanwhile her hand slowly moves up his arm, brushing against his watch, turning him back. One by one, the patrons of the restaurant gasp and go from murmuring to screaming, save one baby, which begins crying. Confused, but still with lips locked, Roxanne opens her eyes and they widen with disbelief as she sees the truth, and him back. His eyes slowly open at first but then also widen. They then pull off of each other, startled by what they're both seeing.]
    Megamind: What? What?
    [he looks down at his hands and realizes]
    Megamind: Haaa! Aaah! Don’t look at me! Just…just a technical glitch! Don’t look yet.
    [he presses buttons on his watch to try and turn himself back into Bernard, but he’s turned into the Warden]
    Megamind: Well, nevermind that.
    [he presses more buttons on this watch]
    Megamind: Ooh! Ow!
    [An oblivious Jor-El turns to Roxanne]
    Megamind: Where were we?
    [Roxanne throws a glass of water at him, shorting the watch and turning him back]
    Roxanne: You!
    Megamind: Now, now, hold on!
    Roxanne Ritchi: You!
    [Roxanne storms out into the pouring rain, trash and cats rehydrating at her feet]
    Megamind: I can explain.
    [Roxanne turns away in anger]
    Megamind: What about everything you just said? About judging a book by its cover?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Well, let’s take a look at the contents then, shall we? You destroyed Metro Man, you took over the city, and then you actually got me to care about you! Why are you so evil? Trickin' me?What could you possibly hope to gain?
    [Megamind looks at her sadly]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Wait a minute. Uhhh! I don’t believe this. Do you really think that I would ever be with you?
    Megamind: [sadly] No.
    [The two part ways and trudge home]
    [Fade to black. Dim blue light illuminates Megamind's desolate lair as the door squeaks open]
    Megamind: Okay, Minion! You were right! I was…less right! We should stick to what we’re good at. Bein' bad. Minion?
    [after he’s put on his Black Mamba suit and prepared himself for his battle with Titan]
    Megamind: Ok, Minion. You were right! I was... less right! We should stick to what we're good at... bein' bad.
    [beat]
    Megamind: Minion?
    [Silence. Megamind looks around, desperate and dejected, until his eyes meet his battle plans. The camera pulls back to his face, and a grimace forms. He whistles for the Brainbots. They gather around him.]
    Megamind (pointing): You there!
    [A Brainbot slaps another one forward, volunteering them]
    Megamind: Yeah, you.
    [The Brainbot nervously quivers and clanks]
    Megamind (hand turning from a pointed finger to an upturned palm, then to a clenched fist): Brin' out... The Black Mamba.
    [The music swells; a dramatic chorus chants Black Mam-baaaaa. Megamind strides over to a pedestal as the cape is removed from its case. The Brainbots prepare Megamind for battle. Cut to a curtain falling, revealing an enormous battle mech]
    Megamind: Okay, Titan! It’s time to go down with style.
    [Cut to Metro City streets, noon. Police vehicles are seen flying down the street as two colossal legs pummel the ground not far behind. Megamind thuds through the city, accompanied by Back in Black, stopping in front of City Hall]
    Megamind: I hear there's a new hero who dares challenge my evil. Where is the one they call Titan? Challenge me, if you dare!
    [He flashes fireworks and saws in a show of force, and then waits. and waits, and waits. Hours pass and Minnie Ripperton intercuts AC/DC. Loving you backs Megamind playing with a car as if a toy to pass the time]
    Megamind (making car noises): Bbbbbbbbbbbbb, EEEERR! Oh, no we're gonna crash! Ahh.
    [He places the automobile in the reflecting pool. It halfheartedly sinks]
    Megamind: Uhhh! This is on embarrassin'!
    [He thumps away to Hal's apartment, fuming]
    Megamind: Of all the inconsiderate, bone-headed, irresponsible, rude, unprofessional! That’s what this is!
    [He crashes through the wall of Hal’s apartment that was just created by Hal before]
    Megamind: Would Metro Man have kept me waiting? Of course not! He was a pro!
    [Hal is sitting in front of his TV, playing a video game]
    Hal: Hey, Megamind. You’re actually the guy I want to see. Also there’s a door here.
    Megamind: Do you have any idea how long I’ve waited for you?
    Hal: No, no, no! I totally understand what you’re saying. Could you just…just shut up for one second, I’m tryin' to beat this level.
    Megamind: Were you even planning on showing up? [Notices something] What's this?
    [Agast, he stares at bags of money, bikes, video game consoles, ATMs]
    Megamind: Where did you get all this stuff?
    Hal: It doesn’t belong to me.
    Megamind: You stole it!?
    Hal: Pretty cool, right?
    Megamind: No, no, no, no! You’re a hero!
    Hal: Being a hero is for losers. It’s work, work, work, twenty-four-seven. And for what? I only took the gig to get the girl and it turns out Roxanne doesn’t want anything to do with me.
    Megamind: Roxanne Ritchi?
    Hal: Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi. I saw her having dinner and makin' at googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb.
    Megamind: Oh.
    Hal: Who needs all that noise! That’s why I think we should team up.
    Megamind: You…wait…what?
    Hal: With my power and your big-headedness, we could rule the city!
    Megamind: You want to team up?
    Hal: I even drew up some new costume designs, see?
    Megamind: Costume designs?
    Hal: You'd be the brains, so you'd get... a little... brain wearing glasses on your costume or something, and since I'm the cool one, I'd have, like, two tanks swordfighting or-
    Megamind: Ugh! I can’t believe you. With all your gifts, all your powers and you… you squander them for your own personal gain!
    Hal: Yes!
    Megamind: No! I'm the villain! You’re the good guy! I do something bad, and you come and get me. That’s why I created you!
    Hal: Yeah, right. You’re nuts! Space dad told me…
    Megamind: Look, I’m your space dad! [he transforms into Jor-El] You should be more like Metro Man!
    Hal: Ah! You tricked me?
    Megamind: Oh, don’t like that, huh? Well, there’s more. [he transforms into Bernard] I’m also the intellectual dweeb datin' Roxanne.
    Hal: No!
    Megamind: (he transforms back into his real form] And we were in smoochin' up a storm! Mwah, mwah, mwah.
    Hal: [Furious] When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna-
    Megamind: Yes, yes, I know! Bring me to justice! Oh, Go-hod, how I've missed this!
    [Hal angrily punches the robot, causing it to fly all the way to the end of the street]
    Megamind: And the hero strikes the first blow! But evil returns with a backhand! Hahahahahaha!
    [Tighten gets thrown from Megamind's blow and submerges into the pavement. He pops up and quick as a flash, shoots through the air and tries to find Megamind, who startles a man on a lift. He brings an enormous finger up to the "head" of the mech]
    Megamind: Shhh! Hahahaha.
    Tighten: Come out you little freak! I wanna see what that big brain looks like on the pavement!
    [Megamind slinks up to a floating Tighten, and gives him a gentle tap on the shoulder. Tighten whips around, and a fist launches him into a building]
    Megamind: You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book!
    Tighten: You little blue twerp!
    [Tighten rockets toward Megamind, who manages to juke him long enough to run around and rip up a lamppost, and upon Tighten's arrival, smashes it into his skull]
    Megamind: En garde! Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
    [Tighten rips up another lamppost and swings it at Megamind, starting a super-powered fencing match]
    Megamind: Now, that's the spirit! Parry! Thrust! Parry again! Now it's time for some witty back-and-forth banter. You go first!
    Tighten: AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!
    Megamind: OK! Look, I'm not sure where to go with that!
    Tighten: This one's for stealin' my girlfriend!
    [He knocks Megamind off his feet and smacks him into the air, following him up as well]
    Tighten: This one's for Space Dad making a fool outta me!
    [He flies down as fast as he can with Megamind and crashes through several stories of a building until their eventual stop. He punches and shatters the dome protecting Megamind and grabs him by the shirt]
    Tighten: And Megamind! This one's for Space Step Mom! You lied to her!
    Megamind: Oh, well done! I thought that battle went really, really well. I mean, I have a few notes.
    Tighten: Notes?
    Megamind: But they can wait. You can take me to jail now.
    Tighten: Oh, no, no, no! I was thinking more like the morgue. You’re dead!
    Megamind: Whoa, whoa, whoa! This isn’t how you play the game!
    Tighten: Game over!
    [Megamind presses a button to eject him before Tighten has the chance to melt him, and flies out of the building]
    Megamind: Ah! Brainbots! Ah!
    [Brainbots barely lift him enough to avoid a bus, and carry him forward as Tighten follows a hair's breadth away]
    Megamind: I'm callin' timeout! Timeout? Timeout! Timeout!
    [The two enter a tunnel as a gas tanker tips over and explodes behind them, launching Megamind out of the tunnel onto the street some distance away. Megamind barely crawls a foot before Tighten becomes visible in the clearing smoke]
    Megamind: Brainbots, initiate the fail-safe.
    [Tighten looms above Megamind. The camera zooms into his face as he raises a fist. A copper dome rushes behind him and drops over him just before he makes his attack. Megamind smugly stands and strolls over to the giant sphere and chuckles]
    Megamind: Guess what, Buster Brown? It’s made from copper. You’re powerless against it. It’s the very same metal used to defeat…
    [Tighten’s fist punches out through the metal]
    Megamind: …Metro Man?
    [Tighten folds the copper back effortlessly]
    Tighten: You should stop comparing me to Metro Man.
    [He picks up the ball and hurls it at Megamind, who miraculously finds and dives into a subway tunnel. Tighten descends, victorious]
    Tighten: You can run, Megamind, but you can't hide!
    Mayor: We’re saved! We’re saved! What’s your name new hero?
    Tighten: It’s Tighten.
    Mayor: Thank you. Thank you! Titan has freed us.
    [the crowd of people in the city cheer]
    Tighten: Oh, I wouldn’t say free. More like, under new management.
    [He flicks the Mayor, sending him flying towards the camera, black. A doorbell rings incessantly and Megamind's huge, blue head appears even more distorted through Roxanne's peephole]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Ugh. What do you want?
    Megamind: Titan’s turned evil.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Congratulations, another one of your genius plans has backfired on you. And why did my doorman let you up?
    [Megamind gives Roxanne a small cube]
    Roxanne Ritchi: *gasp* Carlos!
    [Roxanne tries to shut the door on him]
    Megamind: Please Roxanne, no! No! I need your help.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Why do you need my help?
    Megamind: *sigh* Because you’re the smartest person I know.
    Roxanne: *sigh* But, you can't hide here.
    Megamind: The copper should have worked Why didn't the copper work? The copper worked perfectly well last time!
    Roxanne: Copper? You're not making any sense.
    Megamind: Look, if we don’t find Titan’s weakness he’ll destroy the whole city.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Okay, how can I help?
    Megamind: We need to find answers. You knew Metro Man best, did he have a hideout? A cave? A solitary fortress of some kind? Anything that would give us clues?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Well there is one place I know.
    [Cut to a wheat field rushin' by, and a news van enters the frame as Metro City rests in the background, several buildings smoking]
    Roxanne Ritchi: You gave him these powers, can’t you just take them away?
    Megamind: I can’t. I lost my diffuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car. The night you dumped me. Alone. In the rain. Did you ever look back?
    Roxanne Ritchi: No!
    [She abruptly brakes, causing Megamind head to smash his head on the windshield]
    Megamind: Ow! My giant blue head!
    [they exit the van]
    Megamind: Oh. So... this is where he hid it, after all these years... My old shoolhouse.
    [cut to inside the facility. The two are in a long, dark, grey hallway, approaching a safe door]
    Roxanne: You know, I think there's an apology in order for the other night.
    Megamind: Ok, that would be nice, but make it quick. We have much more pressing matters to deal with]
    Roxanne: Ugh.
    [The door opens and a career of memorabilia is laid out]
    Megamind: Wow. I can't believe he kept all of this stuff! (looks at white cape) Ah, I remember when he wore that.
    Roxanne: Shouldn't we try to stay focused here?
    Megamind: Yes, of course. Right, focused. (he glances back at the cape)
    Roxanne: Hey, come over and look at this!
    [Megamind sprints over and spills into the floor. He excitedly pops up, wearing a white cape]
    Megamind: What is it? What did you find?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Um. Look, this glass has ice cubes in it!
    Megamind: Yes, that’s what happens when water gets cold.
    [They stand up, and Metro Man is standing right behind them, just noticing their presence. He frantically looks around for a means of escape but finds nothing]
    Roxanne Ritchi: No. What I’m sayin' is don’t you think it’s a little odd that the ice hasn’t melted yet?
    Megamind: One of life’s great mysteries.
    [Metro Man turns around slowly and steps away, making the floorboards creak. Roxanne and Megamind slowly turn, horrified]
    Metro Man: Hey!
    [Megamind and Roxanne both scream. Cut to Tighten destroying the city, using his laser vision to carve out something into the streets. Minion watches a news broadcast, worried.]
    Anchorman: We now have confirmed reports. Titan, first thought to be the city's new hero, has turned evil. The city has never seen this level of destruction. If only Metro Man were still alive.
    [Cut to Megamind and Roxanne]
    Roxanne Ritchi: You’re alive?
    Megamind: You’re alive?
    Metro Man: I’m alive.
    Roxanne Ritchi: But…but I…but I we…we saw your skeleton. You were dead.
    Megamind: Are you a ghost?
    Roxanne Ritchi: There had better be an amazing explanation for this.
    Megamind: Speak, apparition.
    Metro Man: [to Megamind and Roxanne] Okay. Okay, okay, okay. You both deserve the truth. lt all started back at the observatory.
    [we see flashback when Metro Man is stuck in the observatory]
    Metro Man: [voice over] Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna stop you. My head wasn’t in the game that day. We were kind of goin’ through the motions. So, using my super speed, I decided to go clear my head. Then I realized, we had done this same silly charade our entire lives. I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling, but I just felt stuck. And I began to realize, despite all my powers, each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn’t: a choice. Ever since I can remember I’ve always had to be what this city wanted me to be. What about what I wanted to do? Then it suddenly hit me, I do have a choice! I can be whatever I wanna be! No one said that this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig. You can’t just quit either. That’s when I got the brilliant idea to fake my death.
    (Past) Metro Man: Copper... drains... my powers.
    (Past) Megamind: Your weakness is copper?
    [Metro Man turns his head away from Megamind's camera and giggles)
    Metro Man: [voice over] Once your death ray hit, I’ve never felt so alive. So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school and Metro Man was finally dead! And Music Man was born!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Music Man?
    Metro Man: That way I can keep my logo.
    Megamind: 'Cause of what?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Come again?
    Metro Man: I was finally free to get in touch with my true power. Weaving lyrical magic. Check this out. [he starts to play the guitar] [singing] I have eyes, that can see, right through lead…
    Roxanne Ritchi: You’re horrible!
    Megamind: Granted you have talent. But there's a madman out there destroyin' our-- your city!
    [Roxanne starts to throw things on to Metro Man’s head]
    Roxanne Ritchi: How could you do this?! The people of the city relied on you, and you deserted them! [smashes his guitar on his head] You left us in the hands of…HIM! [points at Megamind]
    Roxanne Ritchi: [to Megamind] No offense.
    Megamind: No, I’m with you! Look, we need your help.
    Metro Man: I’m sorry. I really am. Um, I’m…I’m done. You know, little buddy, there’s a yin for every yang. If there’s bad, good will rise up against it. It’s taken me a long time to find my calling. Now it’s about time you find yours.
    [Crossfade to outside the shoolhouse]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Hey, who needs him? We can beat Titan ourselves. I say we go back to the evil lair, grab some ray guns, hold ’em sideways and just go all ‘gangsta’ on him.
    Megamind: *sigh* We can’t.
    Roxanne Ritchi: So that’s it. You’re just givin' up?
    Megamind: I’m the bad guy. I don’t save the day. I don’t fly off into the sunset... and I don’t get the girl. I’m going home.
    [sirens are heard in the distance. Megamind drops the white cape he had been wearing, and walks away, dejected. Roxanne, disappointed, picks up the cape, and the camera pans up and zooms in to Metro City. Cut to a prison bus pulling up to the prison, dropping Megamind off. He walks past some guards and up to the warden and puts his arms forward, exposing his wrists. Metro man looks at his suit]
    Anchorman: Unless someone comes to our aid soon, all may be lost. Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus. Remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice. Authorities have issued a warning to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.
    [Tighten finishes up his handiwork, spelling out "Tightenville". He turns his head toward the streets]
    Roxanne: Hal! Hal!
    [He comes crashing down, sending asphalt and rock flying]
    Tighten: Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am, you've finally come to your senses. Well, I'm over you.
    Roxanne: I've come to stop you, Hal.
    Tighten: You? Oh, wow, OK. What are you gonna do? Report me to death?
    Roxanne: I was going to try reasoning with you. You and I, we worked together for a long time. I know you.
    Tighten: You don't know me, you never took the time to know me. This is the first time we've hung out socially, and it's when I'm about to destroy the city.
    Roxanne: I wanna talk to the real Hal. I wanna talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman, and eating dip, and being a nerd and being not as scary as the Titan Hal.
    Tighten: Too late!
    [Cut to Megamind watching TV in his prison cell, flipping through channels aimlessly]
    Tighten (through the TV): Megamind!
    [He passes the channel up, and apathetically puts it back]
    Tighten (through the TV): We have some unfinished business. I'll be waiting at Metro Tower. ANd just so you don't get cold feet...
    [Roxanne appears on TV, attached to the tower by a pipe wrapped around her torso]
    Megamind: Roxanne.
    Tighten: Come on Roxy, call for your hero to come rescue you.
    Roxanne Ritchi: Megamind, I don’t even know if you’re listenin' it. But if you are, you can’t give up! The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight, even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning. It was your best quality. You need to be that guy right now. The city needs you. I need you.
    [to the TV screen]
    Megamind: Roxanne!
    [Tighten moves the TV camera on himself; to Megamind]
    Tighten: You have one hour. Don’t keep me waiting.
    Megamind: Warden! Warden! Listen to me, you have to let me go. Titan has to be stopped!
    Warden: Sorry, Megamind. You still have eighty-eight life sentences to go. Plenty of time to reflect on what you’ve done.
    Megamind: Did you want to hear me say it? I’ll say it. Here it is; from the blackest part of my heart. I am sorry!
    Warden: Not buying it.
    Megamind: Aah... I don’t blame you. I’ve terrorized this city countless times. Created a hero who’s turned out to be a villain. I lied to Roxanne, and, my best friend, Minion, I treated like dirt. Please don’t make this city, don’t make Roxanne pay for my wrongdoings.
    [Warden opens the cell door]
    Warden: Apology accepted.
    [Warden touches a button on his watch and is transformed into Minion]
    Megamind: Oh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you!
    Minion: What are we waiting for? We'd better get goin'.
    Megamind: You got me.
    Warden: Good luck fellas!
    Megamind: We're gonna die!
    [Warden, tied up, nods knowingly]
    Minion: Wait, what?
    [Cut to Tighten]
    Tighten: Hey Metro losers. This is Metro Tower. They say it's supposed to be a symbol of our city's strength, but for ME, it's a cruel reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart. And I hate reminders!
    [Tighten flies down and plows through a floor of the tower, causing the top to start to tilt and topple.]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Hal!
    [Tighten flies back up and lands, keeping it still]
    Roxanne: Please don’t do this. I know there’s still good in you, Hal.
    Tighten: You’re so naive, Roxy. You see the good in everybody, even when it’s not there. You’re livin' a fantasy. There is no Easter Bunny. There is no Tooth Fairy. And there is no Queen of England. This is the real world, and you need to wake up!
    [Black smoke and blue lightning billow and crackle behind Tighten. Welcome to the Jungle bursts out of the fog and beckons thousands upon thousands of Brainbots. The colossal shadow of a gigantic head is seen after each bolt of lightning]
    Megamind: You dare challenge Megamind?!
    Tighten: This town isn’t big enough for two supervillains!
    Megamind: Oh, you’re a villain all right, just not a super one!
    Tighten: Yeah? What’s the difference?
    [Megamind’s giant Brainbot head opens its mouth and from the inside walks Megamind]
    Megamind: Presentation!
    [Tighten flies toward Megamind, and the platform he stood on gave way, as the mouth of the giant head clamps down on Tighten. Megamind rides over on a hover-cycle and disintegrates the pipe trapping her.]
    Roxanne Ritchi: I knew you’d come back.
    Megamind: Well, that made one of us!
    [Tighten bursts out of the head and catches the falling Metro Tower and lifts it to lob at Megamind and Roxanne]
    Roxanne Ritchi: What’s the plan?
    Megamind: Well, it mostly involves not dying!
    Roxanne Ritchi: I like that plan!
    [Tighten throws the tower, and Megamind tries to stay ahead, but its momentum isn't changing in the slightest, and Megamind's losing control of the hover-cycle]
    Roxanne: Building! Go faster! Make this thing go faster!
    Megamind: I can't control it!
    [He looks for an opportunity, and lauches Roxanne to safety, and she lands on the awning od a nearby building. The building keeps coming and the bike wipes out, sending Megamind hurtling towards the camera. He screams, and the screen is black. Roxanne looks up, and sees Megamind impaled on the spire of the tower]
    Roxanne: No.
    [She tries to run over, but is interrupted by Tighten landing]
    Tighten: Well, that was easy. Looks like there's only one loose end now!
    [Tighten kicks a bus at Roxanne. She braces for impact, but there it never comes. Two halves of a bus rest on either side of Roxanne. The camera swivels around, and Metro Man kneels, arm out. He slowly stands and smiles]
    Metro Man: Please, let’s have a little respect for public transportation.
    Roxanne Ritchi: You came back!
    Metro Man: You were right, Roxanne. I never should've left.
    Tighten: Woah! I…I thought you were dead!
    Metro Man: My death was…greatly exaggerated. So, you’re the punk I’ve heard about.
    Tighten: Wah!
    [They take off into the sky, Metro Man furiously pursuing Tighten. Roxanne runs up and holds a wounded Megamind]
    Megamind: I’m sorry. I did the best I could.
    Roxanne Ritchi: I’m so proud of you.
    ["Megamind" touches his watch and he transforms back into Minion. His entier glass bowl had shattered.]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Minion!
    Minion: Surprise! Heh…heh…heh! He’s the real hero.
    [He points to Metro Man chasing Tighten]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Megamind!
    [Close up on "Metro Man's" watch. Camera zooms out, and he's is flying over Tighten who’s trying to get away]
    Megamind: Goin' somewhere?
    Tighten: [surprised] Ah!
    Megamind: Besides jail?
    Tighten: Ah!
    [Metro Man catches Tighten, and grabs him by the suit, arm drawn back, ready to attack]
    Tighten: No, not in the face, man! Please!
    Megamind: You know what's good for you, Titan, you'll stay out of Metrocity!
    Tighten: You got it!
    Megamind: For good!
    [Tighten flies away, Mach cone trailing behind. "Metro Man" descends down to Roxanne, a crowd cheering him. Roxanne extends her hand. Megamind does the same, and she turns off the watch. The crowd is surprised, but supportive. A warm smile finds its way onto everyone's face, while Tighten flies in from behind]
    Tighten: Pretty sneaky, sis. But there’s only one person I know who calls this town Metrocity.
    Megamind: Oops!
    Tighten: You.
    [Megamind rushes Tighten, hitting him with everything he's got. His mechanical hand shatters on Tighten's face]
    Tighten: Bet you think it’s really funny, huh? Let’s all laugh at the really cool guy, huh? You’re not gonna be laughing for long!
    [Tighten fires lasers from his eyes while Megamind desperately tries to evade]
    Roxanne Ritchi: Haa! The invisible car! [shouting to Megamind] Hey, remember that night that I dumped you?!
    Megamind: You're bringing this up now!?
    Roxanne Ritchi: Well, I did look back!
    Megamind: [quietly] You did? [shouts] You did?!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Yes! And you should look back right now!
    Megamind: Ah! I get it!
    [Tighten gets a hold of Megamind]
    Tighten: This is the LAST time you make a fool out of me!!
    Megamind: I made you a hero, you did the 'fool' thing ALL BY YOURSELF!!
    [Tighten launches Megamind back into the wall nearest the car]
    Tighten: You’re so pathetic. No matter what side you’re on, you’re always the loser.
    Megamind: There’s a benefit to losing, you get to learn from your mistakes.
    [he then jumps into the invisible car and grabs the diffuser gun and notices it's labeled "warming up"]
    Megamind: Aw, you've gotta be kidding me! Minion, if I live, I will kill you.
    [A red arm appears through the car door. Tighten rips the door off to find an empty car. He looks at the door and sees Megamind holdin' on for dear life as he presses the "lock" button on the door.
    Tighten: Enjoy your flight!
    [Tighten sends the door, the man, and the gun skyward]
    Roxanne: Megamind!
    Megamind: [voice over] So, this is how it ends. Normally I’d chalk this up to my last glorious failure. But not today! What can I say? Old habits die hard.
    [[He gets out the dehydration gun. Cut to Roxanne on the fountain, crawling back, cornered]
    Tighten: Say bye-bye, Roxie
    [A blue cube lands in the water and Megamind materializes. He snatches the diffuser gun from the air in front of Tighten]
    Megamind: Ollo!
    [he shoves the diffuser gun up Tighten’s nose and pulls the trigger, and Tighten is no more]
    Megamind: Thing about bad guys; they always lose!
    Hal: Ah!
    Roxanne Ritchi: You did it! You won!
    Megamind: Well, I finally had a reason to win. You!
    [Roxanne hugs him and Minion coughs]
    Megamind: Minion!
    Minion: I can’t see, it’s cold and warm, and dark and light.
    Megamind: It’s me, Minion. I’m right here.
    Minion: We’ve had a lot of adventures together, you and I.
    Megamind: We have, Minion.
    Minion: [coughing] Oh…I mean most of them ended in horrible failure, but we won today. Didn’t we, sir?
    Megamind: Yes, Minion. We did it. Thanks to you.
    Minion: Code; We’re The Good Guys Now.
    Megamind: Code; I Guess We Are.
    Minion: Oh…oh…I…I’m goin'! I think this…this is it! I’m going to…! I’m goin' far away!
    [he shakes and coughs and finally closes his eyes. after a moment of reverence and silence, Megamind throws him into the nearby pond water]
    Megamind: Huh! What a drama queen!
    [Minion pops out of the pond water]
    Minion: You know, I’m feelin’ much better now. I guess I just needed a swim.
    Megamind: He had you, didn’t he?
    Roxanne Ritchi: [relieved] Woow!
    Megamind: Classic Minion. Don’t give me that face. Brilliant, that little face. Look at that face!
    Minion: We did it! We did it!
    Megamind: Fist pump!
    Roxanne Ritchi: We did it!
    Megamind: We won! We won! We won!
    [he hugs Roxanne. The crowd gets close as they’re celebrating their victory over destroying Hal; suddenly Megamind pulls out his weapon]
    Megamind: Get back, you savages!
    Roxanne Ritchi: Sorry! Sorry! He’s just not used to positive feedback.
    [Cut to an aerial shot of Metro City. Most of the damage is mitigated or repaired, and Brainbots are visible, carrying up supplies to repair Metro Tower.]
    Megamind: [voice over] Funny, I guess destiny is not the path given to us, but the path we choose for ourselves.
    [Blue lightning envelops a white wall. With a crack and a woosh, the wall is gone, and Megamind emerges]
    Megamind: Alright! Put your hands in the air!
    [The crowd screams with delight, and Megamind points his gun toward the crowd]
    Megamind: Now hand over your wallets!
    [The crowd gasps and falls silent, and he puts the gun away]
    Megamind: I'm just kiddin'! I'm just kiddin'.
    [Cheering returns]
    Megamind: [voice over] I have to admit, being good has its perks.
    [Roxanne dives toward Megamind, trapping him in a hug. She pulls up a white cape around his neck]
    Roxanne Ritchi: You know, you look pretty good in white.
    Mayor: Megamind, if you plea- Aah!
    [Megamind unholsters and fires on the ceremonial ribbon. A gigantic blue curtain falls, and an enormous statue of Megamind stands before the city. Cut to the crowd, and a figure in a trench coat shuffles into frame. A father, whose view is now blocked, taps the figure on the shoulder]
    Father: Uh, hey! My kid can't see!
    [Metro man swivels around and smiles]
    Metro Man: Sorry my friend!
    [He turns back around, not moving an inch]
    Metro Man: Way to go, Little Buddy. I knew he had it in him.
    Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen. Megamind, defender of Metro City!
    [the crowd cheers]
    Megamind: [voice over] You know, I like the sound of that.
    [he suddenly turns]
    Megamind: [voice over] Hit it!
    [Minion, inside the mech, turns up the music playing Michael Jackson’s Bad. The cast all dances, and the camera cuts to the prison, where the warden and two guards look in on Megamind's old cell. Hal is seen dancing in a manner that could be considered funny if it was sped up a couple times and had a funny song playing in the background]
    Hal: I'm bad! I'm bad! That's right. Yeah!
    [Cut back to Megamind, Roxanne, and Minion dancing. Roxanne jumps into Megamind's arms and gives him a kiss on the cheek as the frame turns into newsprint, ending the movie]
    [Roll credits]
    (Bonus scene)[Minion is doing Megamind's laundry back in the lair]
    Minion [singing]: I'm goin' off the rails on a crazy- Aah!
    [The washing machine buzzes and Bernard pops out. A sock rests on his left shoulder]
    Bernard: Aah!
    Minion: Sir, you really need to empty your pockets more often!
    Bernard: *groan* This has been the worst day of my entire life.
    Minion (holding Forget-Me-Stick): Oh, heh heh, no worries!
    [A smack rings out and the rest of the credits roll]
