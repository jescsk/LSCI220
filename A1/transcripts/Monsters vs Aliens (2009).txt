    Susan: [gasping, grunting]
    Dr. Cockroach: You can't crush a cockroach! [cackling]
    [grunting]
    Dr. Cockroach: Right, right. Here we go.
    Susan: Insectosaurus! INSECTOSAURUS! B.O.B.!
    B.O.B.: What?
    Susan: Help me!
    B.O.B.: Sorry. I was staring at this bird over there.
    Susan: We have to get these people off the bridge!
    B.O.B.: Got it.
    Susan: No, B.O.B! Move the drividers!
    B.O.B.: Oh, yeah, you're right. My bad. [laughing]
    Susan: GO, GO, GO, GO! [grunting] Link!
    B.O.B.: Oh, I don't feel good.
    Susan: OK. Susan, you can do this. [grunting]
    Missing Link: All right. Let's take this thing down. [grunts]

    Computer: Retrieval has failed. Don't get upset. It happens to everyone.
    Gallaxhar: [Grows] That lower life form thinks she can steal my Quantonium? Send another probe at once!
    Computer: Quantonium cannot be retrieved via robot. Carbon-based life form, locally known as Susan, is now too strong.
    Gallaxhar: Oh, you think because you're all big and strong and you can destroy my robot probe that you're gonna send me runnin' and hidin'? My days of runnin' and hidin' are over. Computer, set a course to Earth. I will retrieve the Quantonium myself, even if I need to rip it out of her body one cell at a time.
    Computer: Careful, it's hot.
    Susan: Three weeks ago, if you had asked me to defeat a giant robot, I'd have said, "No can do." But I did it! Me! I'm still buzzin'. Did you see how strong I was? Probably isn't a jar in this world I can't open.
    Dr. Cockroach: You were positively heroic, my dear. I especially loved how you saved those people on the bridge. It was a nice touch. Wasn't she amazin', Link?
    Missing Link: Yeah, she was great. Really cool. Loved it.
    Dr. Cockroach: Oh, poor Link. After all that tough talk, you were out-monstered by a girl. No wonder you're depressed.
    Missing Link: Hey, I'm not depressed. I'm tired.
    B.O.B.: Why are you so tired? You didn't do anything.
    Missing Link: Well, I haven't been sleeping well. Right? I got sleep apnea... apnea. Whatever. It's not fun.
    Susan: So Link's a little rusty... I mean, sleep deprived. You'll be back to your old self in no time. And so will I.
    B.O.B.: What happened to the "there isn't a jar in the world I can't open" stuff? Wait. Did you find a jar you couldn't open? Were pickles in it? Where's the giant jar of pickles?
    Dr. Cockroach: What my associate is trying to say is that we all think the new Susan is the "cat's me-ow." I'm sorry.
    Susan: Aw. Thanks, you guys. That is so sweet, but I have a normal life waitin' for me? You know?
    Missing Link: So, uh, tell me, exactly, how this normal life thing works with you being a giant. Ya know.
    Susan: I'm not gonna be a giant forever. Derek won't rest until we've found a cure for my... condition. We're a team.
    Dr. Cockroach: We could all do with a Derek. Perhaps, someday, we could make acquaintance!
    Susan: Really? You guys wanna meet Derek?
    Sheriff W.R. Monger: First stop, Modesto! Ginormica, I called your family to let 'em know you were comin' home. Now, I also called the Modesto PD and told them not to shoot at you.
    Susan: Thanks, General. OK, remember, these people aren't used to seein'... anything like... you, or you... or you. So just be, ya know, cool. Just be... you know... Follow my lead.

    Susan: Stop! That was an accident! Don't destroy anything!

    B.O.B.: Oh, Derek! I missed you so much, thinkin' that we'd someday be together again! It's the only thing that got me through prison! I love you! I love this man!
    Susan: No, B.O.B.! That's my mother! You're suffocating her!
    Dr. Cockroach: Honey, are you all right?
    Wendy: I taste ham.
    Susan: Sorry, Mom. He's just a hugger. Where's Derek?
    Wendy: He's at work, sweetie.
    Carl: He know how he is about his career.

    B.O.B.: Hi. I'm Benzoate-Ostylezene-Bicarbonate. Or you can call me "B.O.B.", whichever's easier. Did I come on too strong? I'm sorry. I'm a little rusty. I've been a prison my whole life. Why'd I mention prison? Oh. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just going to go. I feel so stupid.
    Carl: All right, everyone just stay calm. Whatever you do, do not provoke them.

    Derek: Oh, my goodness. Wait, wait, wait! But, but...!
    Susan: Oh, Derek. You wouldn't believe my last three weeks! Thinkin' about you was the only thing that kept me same.
    Derek: Can't breathe! Ribs collapsing!
    Susan: Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry! Oh, my gosh. Is that better? OK. OK. I'm just still kinda getting used to my new strength.
    Derek: Wow! You really are big!
    Susan: Yeah, but I'm still fine. I'm still the same girl you fell in love with.
    Derek: Except you did just destroy the Golden Gate Bridge.
    Susan: But that was the only way I could stop that giant robot! Did you ever think I could do something like that?
    Derek: No, I didn't. I can honestly say it never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever occured me.
    Susan: Look, I know this is a little weird. OK, it's a lot weird, but we'll figure it out. I know that, together, we can find a way to get me back to normal.
    Derek: Susan, try and look at this from my perspective. I have an audience that depends on me for news, weather, sports and heart-warming fluff pieces. So. You could expect me to put all that on hold while you try to undo this thing happened to you? That I had absolutely nothing to do with?
    Susan: Yes. That's exactly what I expect. But what about the life we always talked about? Don't you still want that?
    Derek: Of course. I just... don't see how I can have that with you.
    Susan: Derek, please, don't do this.
    Derek: You have to face facts, Susan. Don't crush me for sayin' this, but I'm not looking to get married and spend the rest of my life in someone else's shadow. And you're casting a pretty big shadow. I'm sorry. It's over. Good luck, Susan.
    [crying]
    Dr. Cockroach: Wow! What a shindig! Your parents really know how to throw it down.
    Missing Link: What? No, that was a great party, one of the best I've been to since got outta prison.
    B.O.B.: I must've been at a different party, 'cause that's not how I interpreted at all. I don't think your parents liked me, and I think that JELL-O gave me a fake phone number.
    Dr. Cockroach: Well, at least the garbage was free. You know? I mean...
    Missing Link: Ah, who are we kidding? We could save every city on the planet, and they'd still treat us the same way they've always treated us... like monsters.
    Susan: Right. Monsters.
    Missing Link: Anyway, how is Derek?
    Susan: Derek is a selfish jerk.
    B.O.B.: No!
    Susan: Yes. All that talk about "us." "I'm so proud of us. Us just got a job in Fresno." There's no "us." There was only Derek. Why did I have to get hit by a meteor to see that? I was such an idiot! Why did I ever think life with Derek would be so great, anyway? I mean, look at all the stuff I've done without him. Fighting an alien robot? That was me, not him. And that was amazing! Meeting you guys? Amazing! Dr. Cockroach, you can crawl up walls and build a supercomputer outo of a pizza box, two cans of hairspray, and...
    Dr. Cockroach: And a paper clip!
    Susan: Amazing! And you! You hardly need an introduction! You're the Missing Link! You personally carried 250 co-eds off of Cocoa Beach, and still had strength to fight off the National Guard!
    Missing Link: And the Coast Guard and, also, the lifeguard.

    Missing Link: You're gonna make it. It's going to be all right. Look at me. Don't you close those eyes. Don't you dare close those eyes. You can't...
    Gallaxhar: You must be terrified. You wake up in a strange place, wearing strange clothes, imprisoned by a strange bein' floatin' on a strange hovering device. Strange, isn't it?
    Ginormica: Hardly. It's not the first time.
    Gallaxhar: Wow. You really get around. To the extraction chamber!
    Ginormica: Look. What is it that you want from me?
    Gallaxhar: You have stolen what is rightfully mine!
    Ginormica: I didn't steal anything from you.
    Gallaxhar: You're enormous, grotesque body contains Quantonium, the most powerful substance in the universe. Did you really think you could keep it from me?
    Ginormica: That's what this is all about? You destroyed San Francisco, you terrified millions of people... you killed my friend, just to get to me?
    Gallaxhar: Silence! Your voice is grating on my ear nubs. It's a shame you won't be around to see what the power of Quantonium can do in the tentacles of someone who knows how to use it!
    Ginormica: I know how to use it just fine!
    Gallaxhar: Don't bother. That force field is impenetrab... What the Flagnard?
    [grunting]
    Gallaxhar: That should stop your puny... Computer, close door, hangar two! Close door, hangar three! Door, hangar four! Close them all! Computer, begin extraction! [laughing] Finally, I can rebuild my civilization onna new planet. Any thoughts on where I should set up shop? Your planet, perhaps?
    Susan: You keep your slimy tentacles off my planet!
    Gallaxhar: If you wanted to stop me, you should've done it when you possessed the Quantonium! Now you're nothin'.
    Susan:: There are innocent people down there who didn't do anything!
    Gallaxhar: There were innocent people on my home planet before it was destroyed.
    Susan:: Look. I'm sorry your planet was destroyed.
    Gallaxhar: Oh, don't be. I'm the one who destroyed it. Confused? After I reveal my tale to you, everything will become crystal clear. Computer, initialize cloning machine.
    Computer: Yes, Gallaxhar.
    Gallaxhar: Many zentons ago, when I was but a squidlin', I found out parents were... No child should ever have to endure that! So I went on the road with a giant... And soon thereafter was married! Things were going well, until she wanted to... And then I was all, "No way!", and she was all, "Yes, way," and I was like... But I've told you too much already! Let the birth of my new planet, now called... "Gallaxhar's Planet" begin!

    Gallaxhar: Humans of Earth, I have come in peace. You need not to fear me. I mean you no harm. However, it's important to note most of you will not survive the next 24 hours. And those of you who do survive will be enslaved and experimented on. You should have no way take any of this personally. It's just business. So just to recap: I come in peace, I mean you no harm and you all will die. Gallaxhar out.

    Gallaxhar: Yes! Take the prisoner and defective clone to the incinerator!
