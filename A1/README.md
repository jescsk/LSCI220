# Instructions for Notebook Execution
To ensure that the notebook runs successfully:
- Ensure that the `transcripts` folder is in the same location as the `dreamworks.ipynb` file. 

The file structure should look something like this:
```
...
LSCI220
| Student1
| | dreamworks.ipynb
| | transcripts
| | | Bee Movie (2007).txt
| | | ...
